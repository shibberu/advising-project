Academic advis ors meet these obligations through applying frameworks for \ngood practice, including building partnerships with pivotal campus offices such as orientation, first -year student \nprograms, and career services.  \n \nAs the NACADA Concept of Academic Advising (NACADA, 2006)  delineates, academic advising objectives differ \namong institutions based upon the particular mission, goals, curriculum, co -curriculum, and assessment methods \nestablished for the respective campus (White, 2000). However, a representative sample of learning outcomes for \nadvising indicates that students will  \n\u2022 craft a coherent educational plan based on assessment of abilities, aspirations, interests, and values;  \n\u2022 use complex information from various sources to set goals, reach decisions, and achieve those goals;  \n\u2022 assume responsibility for meeting academic program requirements;  \n\u2022 articulate the meaning of higher education and the intent of the institution\u2019s curriculum;  \n\u2022 cultivate the intellectual habits that lead to a lifetime of learning; and  \n\u2022 behave as ci tizens who engage in the wider world around them (NACADA, 2006, para. 10).  \n \nThe increasing public attention placed on college completion means increased visibility for academic advising. \nReports such as Guided Pathways to Success  (Complete College America, 2013) point to academic advising as vital to \ndegree completion.  As institutions seek to increase and diversify enrollments, academic advisors are vital to ensuring \nappropriate matriculation and transfer leading to degree complet ion for all students. The evolving manner by which \nstudents complete college degrees, including the blending of courses offered on a variety of campuses and online, \nplaces new challenges on academic advisors, who must possess the tools needed to meet the d emands of students in \nvirtual space and across multiple institutions (Compete College America, 2013).  \n \nA crucial component of the college experience, academic advising encourages students to cultivate meaning in their \nlives, make significant decisions abou t their futures, and access institutional resources. When practiced with \ncompetence and dedication, academic advising is integral to student success, persistence, retention, and completion. Therefore, academic advisors must develop the tools and skills nec essary to address the many issues that influence \nstudent success and do so with respect to the increasing diversity on college and university campuses.

Civil Engineering\n\nCivil engineering is a people-oriented profession that has long been in existence to serve the needs of mankind. It evolved as a formal discipline at the start of the 19th century with the advent of society\u2019s need for increased mobility and convenience. The role of the civil engineer has always been one that deals primarily with public works: the planning, design, and construction of airports, bridges, buildings, and transportation, irrigation, flood control, water supply and waste disposal systems. These civil engineering works not only manage our environment, but are part of the environment itself and, by their very nature, have important social and economic impacts.\n\nThe civil engineering curriculum is designed to give the student a sound education in preparation for this role. The first two years include courses that deal with the principles of mathematics, physical and engineering sciences on which engineering concepts are based, as well as courses in humanities and social sciences and introductory courses in engineering and design. The last two years are devoted to developing the necessary technical competence, as well as the ability to apply the knowledge that the student has acquired to the design and synthesis of complex civil engineering projects. Project-based learning is an essential ingredient, and a year-long, client-based capstone design project highlights the senior year.\n\nThe entire curriculum is oriented to develop a student\u2019s ability to think critically and logically.

Many of the new wonders that we take for granted in our modern technological society have mathematical ideas and applications as their basis, though this role is often hidden from view. Complex economic and planning decisions, scientific discoveries that improve our lives, and new technologies and products are often possible only after mathematical or statistical analysis, or a computer visualization, simulation, design and implementation based on mathematics. Therefore, mathematicians, as well as mathematically educated scientists, engineers and economists, make important daily contributions in the understanding and advancement of science, the improvement and discovery of new technology, and decision-making and planning in business, industry and government. Students interested in using their mathematical skills in solving real world problems are well prepared, by majoring or minoring in mathematics, for careers such as in the insurance industry, software design, data and systems analysis, scientific computing, combustion research, the animated movie industry, and cryptanalysis to name a few, or a graduate degree in a related technical field. Those students with a very strong interest in mathematics itself can pursue graduate study in mathematics in preparation for careers as university or college mathematics teachers and in the development of new mathematical and statistical concepts and methods as researchers in academia, government and industry.\n\nThe curriculum of the program in the Department of Mathematics is designed to provide a broad education in both theoretical and applied mathematics. It also develops the scientific knowledge and the problem solving, computing, and communications skills that are critical to a successful mathematically based career. This preparation is greatly enhanced by taking advantage of the wide variety of science and engineering courses available to students and developing good communications skills, both through technical courses and the strong humanities program. The program offers a solid grounding in the foundational areas of calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, discrete and combinatorial algebra, and probability and statistics. These basic courses are complemented by a varied selection of upper division courses for further elective study in areas such as numerical analysis, operations research, advanced statistics, mathematical modeling, optimization, and other advanced topics in mathematics. Students are encouraged to develop a strong background in an area of science or engineering through election of courses leading to a minor or double major. By appropriate course selection students may complete a double major in mathematics and another field such as computer science, physics, chemistry, applied biology, or economics.\n\nPROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nTo provide a foundation for further learning as well as contributing to the general education of students, the programs at Rose-Hulman all have a heavy investment in mathematics and science in the first two years. The freshman and sophomore mathematics curriculum is designed to contribute to this foundation by ensuring that students are familiar with basic mathematical and statistical concepts, and mathematical and statistical reasoning and modeling.

The curriculum makes strong use of computer methods to develop students\u2019 mathematical understanding and to enhance their ability to use the computer in modeling, computation and problem solving.\n\nFor students seeking a major in mathematics, the curriculum prepares them for a mathematically based career after graduation or further graduate study. The major builds upon the goals and objectives of the freshman and sophomore curriculum. In addition to a deeper and broader study of mathematics, majors will further develop their ability to formulate and solve problems from a mathematical perspective, become familiar with the use of mathematics in other fields, and develop competence at the application of mathematics to at least one other field. Graduates will also be able to use technology effectively in mathematics and the application of mathematics.

Software Engineering\n\nSoftware engineering is the creation of software using a process similar to other engineering disciplines. It allows for software to be reliable and developed within time and cost estimates. The software engineering curriculum prepares students for a career in reliable, economical software development.\n\nProgramming is only one phase (construction) of software engineering. There are many other aspects of the software engineering process, such as requirements definition, architectural design, and quality assurance, which need to be applied in order to develop reliable software on time and within budget constraints. The software engineering curriculum provides students a solid background in both the theory and practice of all phases in the software engineering process, beginning with their first course of study in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, and continuing to the end of the senior year.\n\nSince software is a non-physical product developed and executed on computers, the software engineering curriculum has computer science as its primary engineering science. The computer science courses taken by software engineering majors include the study of algorithms, data structures, database concepts, computer architecture, programming languages and operating systems. Software engineering majors also complete important courses in other closely related fields, such as discrete mathematics, digital logic design, and engineering statistics.\n\nCoverage of software engineering topics begins in a three-term introduction to software development during the freshman and sophomore years. This study continues with coverage of core software engineering areas in the junior year, including software requirements, software architecture, software design, software project management, software construction, software maintenance, software evolution, software quality assurance, and formal methods in software specification and design. All of these courses include individual and team projects relevant to that particular area of software engineering.
