The major focus in this document is on \nthe procedures of the Institute Rules and Discipline Committee, since rules","35":"pg. 12 governing general student conduct are discussed in the appropriate student \nhandbooks.  \n2. There are two major areas of jurisdiction. The Dean of Students and the \nDean's staff handle cases of Non -Academic Misconduct. Individual faculty \nmembers and the Institute Rules and Discipline Committee handle cases of \nAcademic Misconduct. All cases of misconduct must be reported to the Dean of Students.  \n3. Whenever a student is charged with N on-Academic Misconduct, a disciplinary \nconference will be scheduled with the Dean of Students.  \n4. Any student charged with misconduct is urged to consult with the Dean of Students or the Chairperson of the Institute Rules and Discipline Committee to be informed of the procedures that will be followed and to receive \nassistance in preparing a defense.  \nGeneral Policy  \n1.
