A student with a sufficiently high score on the departmental examination will be given the option of enrolling in CHEM112, General Chemistry Honors, which carries 5 hours of credit. The student will then be exempted from the required chemistry sequence--CHEM111 and CHEM113, General Chemistry I and II--which carries 8 hours of total credit. Upon completion of CHEM112 with a passing grade, the student will also be granted 3 additional hours of Credit by Examination, (so that the total of 8 credits represents the 8 credits normally earned in CHEM111 and CHEM113).\n\nComputer Science: Students with computer science experience not assessed by an AP exam may take the online computer science placement examination prior to enrollment.

Upon successful completion of that course with a C or better, the student will also receive Credit by Examination for the course or courses bypassed. Additionally, if a student has already placed into CSSE220 due to the AP exam, they may use the placement examination to try to place into CSSE230.\n\nForeign Language: A student who qualifies through the foreign language examination will be permitted to enroll in the appropriate level of German, Spanish, or Japanese as determined by the foreign language faculty. Upon successful completion a quarter of more advanced language at Rose-Hulman with a grade of C or better, the student will be granted 4 hours of Credit by Examination for each quarter of language by-passed.

The exam will be administered during Freshmen Orientation week, and registration information will be sent to students prior to their arrival on campus.\n\nMilitary Science/Air Science: A U.S. veteran with one year's service and members of a reserve component of the U.S. armed forces may be given Credit by Examination for Basic Military/Air Science. Also, see Military/Air Science.\n\nPhysics: A student who qualifies through the physics placement examination administered during Freshman Orientation Week will be given 4 hours of Credit by Examination for PH111, Physics I.\n\nCourse Examination\n\nA student may receive Credit by Examination through successful performance on a comprehensive examination covering the material of a course. The student must apply to the head of the appropriate department for such an exam and it is subject to the following limitations.\n\nThe granting of Credit by Examination is normally limited to courses or areas available at Rose-Hulman or compatible with the curricula offered at Rose-Hulman.\n\nCredit by Examination cannot be used to make up a course failure (F or WF).\n\nCredit by Examination carries no grade and does not affect the student's GPA.\n\nEvaluation of special examinations will be made by the head of the department to determine whether a sufficient demonstration of knowledge of the particular course has been made to warrant Credit by Examination.\n\nCourse By-Passing\n\nA student might, by reason of previous experience, be challenged little by a particular course.

If a\n student is dropping to part-time for the third time (or more), approval\n is required from the Admissions and Standings Committee.\nA \nstudent who wishes to drop a course after the eighth week must have \npermission from the Admissions and Standings Committee because of \nspecial exigency. For more information see\u00a0Grades.\nIf\n the penalty levied by an instructor in a case of academic misconduct is\n failure in the course, the student forfeits the right to withdraw from \nthe course with a grade of \"W\".\nChanges in a student's schedule \nnecessitated by illness, Military Service, or other exigencies beyond \ncontrol, may be made without penalty at any time upon approval of the \nAdmissions and Standing Committee.\nGrade Replacement\nRose-\nHulman recognizes that some students may have deficiencies in their \nbackground that may necessitate their repeating certain named required \ncourses. The Grade Replacement provision allows them to remedy these \ndeficiencies without grade penalty. It is also intended to encourage \nstudents who have received a marginal grade (D or D+) in a core course \nto repeat the course before proceeding to more advanced work.\u00a0\nStipulations:\u00a0If\n a student receives a penalty grade (F, D, or D+) in a named course \nrequired in the first two years of the curriculum and repeats the \ncourse, then only the higher grade in the course will be used in \ncalculating the cumulative GPA. (In effect, the cumulative GPA will be \nre-calculated, dropping out the lower grade.)\u00a0\nThis procedure may be applied to not more than two named required courses of the junior-senior curriculum.\u00a0\nLimitations\nAll grades will be recorded; that is, the prior penalty grade will not be removed from the student's permanent record.\nIf the penalty grade was an F, the student must repeat the course \nprior to taking any other course for which the repeated course is a \nprerequisite.\nGrade replacement cannot be used for a course in which a penalty grade was assigned for disciplinary reasons.\nProcedure\nThe student simply registers as\n usual for any courses for which Grade Replacement applies. If a \nstudent, after registering, finds that a course must be repeated (e.g., \nafter final grades have been reported), a\u00a0Drop/Add\u00a0Form must be obtained during the first week of classes in the next term.\u00a0\nOverloads\nThe\n maximum academic load is 18 credits in any term, excluding RHIT100 \nFoundations for Rose-Hulman Success, one credit hour of General \nChemistry Honors, and Music Performance. A student wishing to take more \nthan the maximum normal load must petition the Admissions and Standings \nCommittee, except as noted below.\nOverload policy\nWith the approval of the\u00a0Advisor, a student who is not on academic\u00a0Probation, may schedule credits in addition to the maximum normal load according to the following table:\nCumulative GPA\nMaximum Overload\nLess than 2.600\nno overload\nAt least 2.600\n4 credits\nAt least 3.300\n6 credits\nProcedure\nA student whose GPA meets the stipulated limit for the Overload may simply register as usual.\nA student whose GPA does not meet the stipulated limit must request \nan Overload by submitting a letter to the Registrar explaining why the \nexception is needed, how the additional work load will be handled, and \nindicate which course(s) are considered to be the Overload. The \nAdmissions and Standing Committee will meet to consider these requested \nOverloads, usually after the final grades for the current term are in. \nThe Committee will typically notify students of its decision during the \nsecond week of classes. The fact that a student is pursuing a double \nmajor or two degrees is NOT a sufficient reason for approving an \nOverload for a student who does not meet the GPA requirement. If the \npetition is denied, the student will be informed and the Overload \ncourse(s) will be dropped.\nFees\nStudents\n pay an additional fee for each credit over 18 in a term, exclusive of \nRHIT100 Foundations for Rose-Hulman Success. Consult the Registrar's \nOffice.\nPart-Time Student\nEnrollment\n in at least 12 credits of course work in any one term constitutes being\n a Full-Time Student. A student enrolled for fewer than 12 credits of \ncourse work in any one term is classified as a Part-Time Student or \nSpecial Student.\u00a0\nGuidelines\nA student may register as a Part-Time Student or reduce their course \nload to become a Part-Time Student at their discretion. Being a \nPart-Time Student may have implications for:\n\u2022 Financial aid and student loan repayment**\n\u2022 Insurance\n\u2022 Visa status for international students\n\u2022 Eligibility for athletics\n\u2022 Scheduling of required courses with prerequisites\n\u2022 Other individual-specific concerns (e.g., ROTC contracted cadets)\nStudents intending to be a Part-Time Student should discuss these\n implications with their advisor and a representative from the Financial\n Aid Office, if appropriate. International students must discuss their \nintention to be a Part-Time Student with the Senior Director of the \nCenter for Global Engagement.\u00a0\nLimitations\nAcademic probation can only be removed for satisfactory work as a Full-Time Student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.\nIf a student wishes to be a Part-Time Student for more than two \nquarters (consecutive or non-consecutive), permission must be requested \nfrom the Admissions and Standing Committee.\u00a0 Before granting \npermission for a third term of Part-Time study, the Committee will \nevaluate whether the student is making satisfactory academic \nprogress.\u00a0\nExceptions & Questions:\u00a0Consult the\u00a0Admissions and Standing Committee.\n**As outlined in the Student Handbook\n (Changes to Part Time Status During a Term), any reduction in hours \nwill result in an adjustment of financial aid based on the schedule \nbelow through the end of Week 6:\nReduction from full time hours (12+) to 3/4 time hours (9-11) = 25% reduction of aid\nReduction from full time hours (12+) to 1/2 time hours (6-9) = 50% reduction of aid\nReduction from full time hours (12+) to 1/4 time hours (5 or less) = 100% reduction of aid\nProbation & Dismissal\nAt the end of any term, a student whose term\u202fGrade Point Average\u00a0\n(GPA) or cumulative GPA falls below the level shown in the following \ntable will be placed on Academic Probation for the succeeding term. A\u202fTransfer Student\u202fassumes the GPA requirements of the class the student enters.\nTerms\nMinimum Term GPA\nMinimum Cumulative GPA\n1-3\n1.800\n1.800\n4-12\n2.000\n2.000\nIf a student's term GPA falls below the \nrequired level, the student acquires one probation. If a student's \ncumulative GPA falls below the required level, the student acquires one \nprobation. It is thus possible for a student to acquire a maximum of two\n probations in one quarter.\u00a0\nAny\n student placed on probation in a given term can be required to appear \nbefore the Admissions and Standing Committee as a condition of remaining\n in the Institute.\u00a0\nRemoval of academic probation\nAt\n the end of any term in which a student was enrolled in 12 hours or \nmore, and whose term GPA and Cumulative GPA meet the minimum level as \nshown in the table above, the student will be removed from academic \nprobation.\u202fAll courses must be taken for graded credit, and may not \ninclude courses on the Audit or\u202fPass/Fail\u00a0basis.\u00a0\nDismissal for academic deficiency\nA student who acquires a total of three probations in immediately \nsuccessive terms will be dismissed from the Rose-Hulman Institute of \nTechnology.\nA student who acquires three probations will be allowed to remain in\n school for one term if the student's term GPA is 2.500 or better. The \nstudent must be enrolled as a full-time student and all courses must be \ntaken for graded credit, and may not include courses on the Audit or\u202fPass/Fail\u00a0basis.\nPart-time student\u00a0\nThe Admissions and \nStanding Committee may permit a student on probation or one who has been\n dismissed and re-admitted to enroll as a\u202fPart-Time Student.\n If sufficient GPA improvement is achieved, the student may be permitted\n to remain in school, but the probationary status will not change. \nProbation can only be removed for satisfactory work as a Full-Time \nStudent.\u00a0\nReadmission\nAny student who has been dismissed for academic reasons\n or who has withdrawn voluntarily from Rose-Hulman and wishes to be \nreadmitted must make a personal appearance before the Admissions and \nStanding Committee. The student must contact the Registrar regarding \nmeeting times and dates. The Admissions and Standing Committee will \ndetermine whether the student shall be readmitted.\u00a0\nAny student who has been suspended for disciplinary reasons\n and wishes to be readmitted at the end of the suspension period must \nsubmit a written petition to the Dean of Students who will review it. \nAfter the review, the Dean of Students will submit a recommendation to \nthe Admissions and Standing Committee. In addition, the student will \nschedule and attend a meeting with the Admissions and Standing Committee\n as a condition of readmission. The student must contact the Registrar \nregarding meeting times and dates. The Admissions and Standing Committee\n will determine whether the student shall be readmitted. StipulationThe \nstudent may not appear before the Admissions and Standing Committee \nuntil all outstanding financial obligations to the Institute are \nsettled.\nRepeating a Course\nOverlapping material\nIn\n some instances, with the approval of the advisor, a student may elect \nto take a course which essentially repeats material in a course already \ntaken and for which credit has been received. In such cases, no \nadditional credits or grade points will be recorded unless the second \ncourse carries more hours of credit. In that case, credit and grade \npoint will be recorded to the extent by which the total number of \ncredits for the second course exceeds those recorded for the original \ncourse. The exception to this is\u202fGrade Replacement.\nFailed courses\nA\n student who has received an \"F\" in a course must repeat the entire \ncourse in order to obtain credit, either by enrolling for it again at \nRose-Hulman or by\u202fTransfer Credit. It is particularly important to note that:\nCredit By Examination\u00a0may not be used to obtain credit for failed courses;\nThe\n \"F\" will remain on the student's permanent record and cannot be removed\n by subsequent satisfactory work. (This is true even in the case of\u202fGrade Replacement\u00a0where the \"F\", although no longer averaged into the student's GPA, still remains on the academic record.\nExceptions & Questions:\u00a0Consult the\u00a0Admissions and Standing Committee.\nTransfer Credits\nCourses\n successfully completed at other accredited institutions of higher \nlearning may be submitted for transfer credit and possible satisfaction \nof Rose-Hulman degree requirements.\nEach request for transfer \ncredit is evaluated by the head of the department awarding the credit; \nthe award of transfer credit is not automatic. All courses are reviewed \nto confirm that they meet the academic expectations of the department \nissuing credit; some have additional restrictions. Some courses are not \neligible for completion via transfer credit and must be taken at \nRose-Hulman. Some may be eligible for credit by exam but not for \ntransfer credit. These restrictions may be indicated in the Academic \nRules and Procedures, in the Course Catalog, or by the head of the \nrelevant academic department.\nSome pre-collegiate programs may \nbear academic credits that are not transferable to Rose-Hulman. For \nexample, Rose-Hulman does not award credit for Project Lead the Way \n(PLTW) courses.\nRose-Hulman\u2019s own summer courses and online \ncourses are not transfer courses and are not subject to the limits \nstated below.

{"source": "chemical-engineering.txt", "text": "The chemical engineering master's programs offer a unique opportunity for an individual to broaden and enhance his or her undergraduate training with concentrated study in a specialized area of chemical engineering. The program is a blend of \"traditional\" programs based on full-time, resident graduate activity and \"industrial\" programs that can be beneficial to students employed in nearby industries or to those who want to alternate periods of full-time graduate work and full-time work in industry.\n\nThe department offers two graduate path alternatives. Our Master of Science (MS) degree program is a traditional thesis-based approach whereby the student pursues both laboratory and course work culminating in the preparation and oral defense of a written thesis. Our Master of\u00a0Chemical Engineering (MChE) degree is a course-based master's program which requires additional coursework or project study in lieu of a traditional thesis.\n\nAreas of specialization within our department include energy and sustainability, separations, biochemical engineering and biosystems, process and transport modeling, process control and optimization, petroleum engineering, thermodynamics and molecular simulations, polymers, interfacial phenomena and nanotechnology, and particulate materials.\n\nThe department also offers undergraduate students who are ahead in their courses to work towards a master's degree while still completing their bachelor's degree. Students who wish to pursue this path should talk to their advisors.\n\nThe objective of both programs, the Master of Chemical Engineering and Master of Science in Chemical Engineering, is to prepare graduates for early career advancement in the field of Chemical Engineering by building upon their undergraduate training with advanced coursework and concentrated study of problems and topics relevant to the field.\n\nMaster of Chemical Engineering and Master of Science in Chemical Engineering Student Learning Outcomes\n\nApply advanced principles to solve complex chemical engineering problems.\n\nRelate course concepts to current topics of interest in chemical engineering industry or research.\n\nFaculty and Staff Contacts\n\nMaster of Science (MS) in Chemical Engineering requirements\n\n36 credit hours of course work\n\n12 credit hours of thesis work\n\nCore Coursework\u00a0(12 credit hours required)\n\nAn advanced engineering thermodynamics course (CHE 513 or ME 501 or equivalent)\n\nAn advanced course in fluid flow and/or heat transfer (CHE 502 or ME 503 or equivalent)\n\nTransport Phenomena II (CHE 503) or Advanced Reactor Design (CHE 504)\n\nMinor Coursework\u00a0(8 credit hours required)\n\nAn area of concentration approved by the thesis advisory committee\n\nElectives\n\nA minimum of 16 credit hours of electives approved by the advisory committee is required.

{"source": "engineering-management.txt", "text": "ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT\n\nThe engineering management master's program facilitates students' educational experiences to distinguish themselves from other engineers in the workplace. Through various instruction modes and experiences, students develop leadership and technical skills to positively address the human (behavioral) and technical opportunities presented in today's global work environment. The goal is to provide students with discipline-free managerial, leadership, and technical skills that accentuate their undergraduate STEM degrees and elevate their career trajectories.\n\nThe department offers two variations of the master's degree: Master of Science in Engineering Management (MSEM) and Master of Engineering Management (MEM).\u00a0 The MSEM degree requires a combination of coursework and a capstone project, while the MEM degree does not require a capstone project but instead requires eight (8) additional credit hours of graduate-level coursework. Both degree programs require three (3) one-credit hour EMGT graduate seminars, which expose students to relevant engineering management topics and experts that they would not be exposed to in other classes.\n\nWithin the course offerings of engineering management, students can explore the areas of entrepreneurship, operations, Six Sigma, and systems engineering as they relate to the discipline.\n\nBoth degrees' objective is to prepare graduates for a diverse set of career opportunities in STEM fields or career advancement in their current field of study. We achieve these objectives by building upon their undergraduate training with advanced coursework and topics relevant to the engineering management discipline.\n\nMSEM and MEM Graduate Student Learning Outcomes\n\nStudent Outcomes are statements that describe what students are expected to have by the time of graduation.\n\nAcquire and apply knowledge or skills to demonstrate an understanding of political, economic, social, technical, environmental, or legal (PESTEL) issues relevant to engineering management.\n\nApply engineering or managerial knowledge to analyze organizational concerns or devise solutions utilizing appropriate qualitative or quantitative tools.\n\nMeet objectives or create value (for a project, process, or organization) through individual or collaborative effort.\n\nMaster of Science in Engineering Management (MSEM)\n\nThe MSEM degree curriculum includes eight credit hours of an integrated project for students who want to investigate business practices, managerial principles, and engineering concepts and their impact on organizational operations. Students will be able to engage in research related to the engineering management discipline. Course requirements for the MSEM degree include:\n\n20 credit hours of technical courses\n\n20 credit hours of managerial courses\n\n8 credit hours of Integrated Project (2 credit hours for proposal and 6 credit hours for research)\n\n3 credit hours of EMGT Graduate Seminar\n\nThere is some flexibility with the balance of credits between the technical (20 credits) and managerial (20 credits) areas.\u00a0 In consultation with your academic advisor and with approval from the Department Head, a student may be allowed to shift some credits between these two areas, weighting one area more than the other.\n\nMaster of Engineering Management (MEM)\n\nThe MEM degree is a course-based professional degree for students seeking an in-depth understanding of the engineering management discipline and its application to their undergraduate program of study.\u00a0 Like MSEM students, MEM degree seekers develop business acumen and management/leadership skills to solve the socio-technical demands of today's workplace.

Chemists are employed in research, quality control, design, sales and management. Many graduates pursue masters and doctoral degrees in chemistry, biochemistry, medicinal chemistry, materials science, or environmental science, among others. A chemistry degree is excellent preparation for medical school and related fields, and also for careers in business, law or education.\n\nThe curriculum at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology provides a rigorous introduction to all subdisciplines of chemistry. Students have access to modern instrumentation, a new biochemistry lab, and a new environmental chemistry lab. Rose-Hulman students are introduced to modern computational methods beginning in the sophomore year. There are many opportunities for research or other individual projects, and students are encouraged to present their results at regional and national chemistry conferences.

The first two years include courses that deal with the principles of mathematics, physical and engineering sciences on which engineering concepts are based, as well as courses in humanities and social sciences and introductory courses in engineering and design. The last two years are devoted to developing the necessary technical competence, as well as the ability to apply the knowledge that the student has acquired to the design and synthesis of complex civil engineering projects. Project-based learning is an essential ingredient, and a year-long, client-based capstone design project highlights the senior year.\n\nThe entire curriculum is oriented to develop a student\u2019s ability to think critically and logically.

{"source": "Engineering%20Design.txt", "text": "Students also work with external clients starting in their first quarter on campus.\n\nEngineering Design\n\nEngineering design is a human-centered endeavor that grew out of investigations of creativity.\u00a0 While design is an integral part of all engineering fields, design methodology gained more attention during the 1980s as global competition demanded higher quality design and system complexity increased. The role of the designer is to create a system, process, product, or service based on stakeholder needs while considering social, environmental, economic, and safety requirements. The designer must have both a mindset and skillset for improving the impact of design on society. The mindset requires the vision and drive necessary to create value. The skillset includes the tools and techniques critical to realize the design.\n\nThe Engineering Design major prepares students by giving them repeated, intensive design experiences with real clients. From the first quarter to the senior year, students participate in authentic design experiences and practice professional skills. The first year gives students a broad understanding of modeling systems across disciplines and repeated practice in prototyping solutions for clients. Students select a concentration and prepare for their practicum as they continue deeper in the design process. Second year students also learn the process of on-boarding into existing projects as they work with seniors one quarter and freshmen another. Transitioning to the third year, students participate in two 20-week practicums. Students are required to delve into the design process. In the junior year, the curriculum is structured to allow study-work abroad and/ or cooperative work experiences. In their senior year, students complete their concentrations and participate in a year-long, multidisciplinary capstone design experience.\n\nAfter completion of this curriculum, students will be prepared to enter the engineering profession or advanced study. A student may also use this academic background as a stepping stone to a position in management, administration, or some other non-engineering field.\n\nEngineering Design Mission Statement\n\nEngineering Design employs repeated, immersive design experiences to cultivate students who\n\nEmbrace the ambiguity of design\n\nSelect design processes from multiple disciplines as appropriate to the project\n\nTackle projects with gusto\n\nCommit to professional and ethical responsibilities while remembering global, social, economic, and environmental considerations\n\nCommunicate respectfully and effectively\n\nCreate collaborative and inclusive teams\n\nEngineering Design Program Educational Objectives\n\nIn support of our mission and based on the needs of our constituents, alumni from our program are expected to attain:\n\nEthically-minded solutions to open-ended problems using engineering and/or design principles\n\nRecognition as skilled engineers and/or designers\n\nMeaningful, collaborative work\n\nActive involvement in professional & personal development\n\nContributions to society locally, nationally, or globally\n\nRecognition as facilitators of multidisciplinary teams\n\nStudent Outcomes\n\nAttainment of these outcomes prepares graduates to enter the professional practice of engineering.\n\nan ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics\n\nan ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors\n\nan ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences\n\nan ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts\n\nan ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives\n\nan ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgement to draw conclusions\n\nan ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies\n\nThe engineering design program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org, under the commission\u2019s General Criteria with no applicable program criteria.\n\nTechnical Electives\n\nEngineering Design students have 24 credit-hours for technical electives.\u00a0 ", "lemma": "Students also work external client start first quarter campus.

{"source": "Mathematics.txt", "text": "Mathematics\n\nWhy study mathematics? Many of the new wonders that we take for granted in our modern technological society have mathematical ideas and applications as their basis, though this role is often hidden from view. Complex economic and planning decisions, scientific discoveries that improve our lives, and new technologies and products are often possible only after mathematical or statistical analysis, or a computer visualization, simulation, design and implementation based on mathematics. Therefore, mathematicians, as well as mathematically educated scientists, engineers and economists, make important daily contributions in the understanding and advancement of science, the improvement and discovery of new technology, and decision-making and planning in business, industry and government. Students interested in using their mathematical skills in solving real world problems are well prepared, by majoring or minoring in mathematics, for careers such as in the insurance industry, software design, data and systems analysis, scientific computing, combustion research, the animated movie industry, and cryptanalysis to name a few, or a graduate degree in a related technical field. Those students with a very strong interest in mathematics itself can pursue graduate study in mathematics in preparation for careers as university or college mathematics teachers and in the development of new mathematical and statistical concepts and methods as researchers in academia, government and industry.\n\nThe curriculum of the program in the Department of Mathematics is designed to provide a broad education in both theoretical and applied mathematics. It also develops the scientific knowledge and the problem solving, computing, and communications skills that are critical to a successful mathematically based career. This preparation is greatly enhanced by taking advantage of the wide variety of science and engineering courses available to students and developing good communications skills, both through technical courses and the strong humanities program. The program offers a solid grounding in the foundational areas of calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, discrete and combinatorial algebra, and probability and statistics. These basic courses are complemented by a varied selection of upper division courses for further elective study in areas such as numerical analysis, operations research, advanced statistics, mathematical modeling, optimization, and other advanced topics in mathematics. Students are encouraged to develop a strong background in an area of science or engineering through election of courses leading to a minor or double major. By appropriate course selection students may complete a double major in mathematics and another field such as computer science, physics, chemistry, applied biology, or economics.\n\nPROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES\n\nTo provide a foundation for further learning as well as contributing to the general education of students, the programs at Rose-Hulman all have a heavy investment in mathematics and science in the first two years. The freshman and sophomore mathematics curriculum is designed to contribute to this foundation by ensuring that students are familiar with basic mathematical and statistical concepts, and mathematical and statistical reasoning and modeling. Students will also understand the use of mathematics in other disciplines as well as developing an appreciation of mathematics as a discipline in its own right. In addition, students will learn to be competent users of mathematics, especially in problem solving, and be able to effectively communicate mathematically. The curriculum makes strong use of computer methods to develop students\u2019 mathematical understanding and to enhance their ability to use the computer in modeling, computation and problem solving.\n\nFor students seeking a major in mathematics, the curriculum prepares them for a mathematically based career after graduation or further graduate study. The major builds upon the goals and objectives of the freshman and sophomore curriculum. In addition to a deeper and broader study of mathematics, majors will further develop their ability to formulate and solve problems from a mathematical perspective, become familiar with the use of mathematics in other fields, and develop competence at the application of mathematics to at least one other field. Graduates will also be able to use technology effectively in mathematics and the application of mathematics. To complement these technical skills graduates will learn the professional skills of effective communication with both technical and non-technical audiences and the ability to work cooperatively with others.\n\nMathematics Program Goals and Student Learning Outcomes\n\nMathematics majors should be able to meet the following Student Learning Outcomes\n\nGoal 1:\u00a0 Students will learn the fundamental principles underlying the major areas of mathematics\n\nSLO 1.1.\u00a0 Perform calculations and prove statements about objects, morphisms, and structure theorems in vector spaces and abstract algebra.\n\n", "lemma": "Mathematics study mathematics?

The department has a form for the planning and approval of a mathematics minor.\n\nNotes and Limitations on Requirements:\n\nAlmost all students are required to take six foundational courses as a requirement for their major; therefore only four \"extra courses\" are required for most students.\n\nOnly MA111, MA112, MA113, MA221, MA222 and one of MA223, MA381, or MA382 can be counted towards any combination of the multiple minors offered by the mathematics department.\n\nNo student can take both MA 371 and MA 373 for credit.\n\nNo student can take both MA223 and MA382 for credit\n\nExcept as noted above, if MA 381 is being counted towards the four additional courses then, MA 223 may be taken and counted towards the Introductory Statistics and Probability.\n\nScience and engineering, especially the most recent \"high tech\" developments, have sophisticated mathematical and statistical concepts and methodologies as their foundation.

{"source": "Optical%20Engineering.txt", "text": "This leadership is in no way limited to only traditional areas of study. One of these new areas that had a high impact in technology is optical communications. It is a rapidly growing field requiring investment beyond the traditional program structure, and is well suited to the students at Rose-Hulman\u00a0All these topics are closely related to well established disciplines as optics and electronics.\u00a0Considerable R&D efforts are allocated in both university and industrial laboratories enhancing the demand for both researchers and engineers with expertise in the field.\n\nWe propose the creation of a new certificate program in Optical Communications to enhance the programs currently offered. Combining expertise in Optical and Electrical Engineering, this program requires an interdisciplinary emphasis that is beyond the traditional content of either of its parent programs. This program is more than just the creation of the certificate program Optical Communications. This program will be critical to help developing a more interdisciplinary interaction for students and faculty. The creation of a workgroup within the faculty of both departments will coordinate current courses and resources, create new courses of interest for the field, and develop a showcase testbed education and research laboratory. Primary objectives include the removal of redundancy from existing courses, increasing interaction between the PHOE and ECE Departments, and improving opportunities for students in the field.\n\nThis certificate is designed to give the student a firm theoretical and practical working knowledge in the area of fiber optic devices, optical communications, networks and its applications. The main purpose is to couch these fundamentals in a context that serves as the backbone for device, components and sub-system development for use in high-speed optical data and information links and networks. At the end of the program the student will be expected to:\n\nUnderstand the fundamental operation characteristics of high-speed optoelectronic components, such as laser transmitters, light modulators and receivers and passive fiber optic components as connectors, couplers, filters, and switches.\n\nUnderstand the technology and performance of analog and digital fiber optic links, optical amplification and optical wavelength division multiplexing and optical time division multiplexing networks.\n\nHave hands-on working knowledge of the use of fiber optic test equipment and techniques used by industry and telecommunication companies to test the performance of optical fiber links and components, such as, optical time domain reflectometry, optical spectrum analyzers and optical bit error testing equipment.\n\nThe Certificate will consist of 20 credit hours of which 12 credit hours will be required courses.

{"source": "Software%20Engineering.txt", "text": "Software Engineering\n\nSoftware engineering is the creation of software using a process similar to other engineering disciplines. It allows for software to be reliable and developed within time and cost estimates. The software engineering curriculum prepares students for a career in reliable, economical software development.\n\nProgramming is only one phase (construction) of software engineering. There are many other aspects of the software engineering process, such as requirements definition, architectural design, and quality assurance, which need to be applied in order to develop reliable software on time and within budget constraints. The software engineering curriculum provides students a solid background in both the theory and practice of all phases in the software engineering process, beginning with their first course of study in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, and continuing to the end of the senior year.\n\nSince software is a non-physical product developed and executed on computers, the software engineering curriculum has computer science as its primary engineering science. The computer science courses taken by software engineering majors include the study of algorithms, data structures, database concepts, computer architecture, programming languages and operating systems. Software engineering majors also complete important courses in other closely related fields, such as discrete mathematics, digital logic design, and engineering statistics.\n\nCoverage of software engineering topics begins in a three-term introduction to software development during the freshman and sophomore years. This study continues with coverage of core software engineering areas in the junior year, including software requirements, software architecture, software design, software project management, software construction, software maintenance, software evolution, software quality assurance, and formal methods in software specification and design. All of these courses include individual and team projects relevant to that particular area of software engineering. These projects generally include both written and oral presentations, building upon a technical communication course which introduces the student to the skills necessary for this important aspect of being a software professional. Throughout the senior year, a capstone team project develops and delivers software for a \u201creal-world\u201d client, which is put on display locally at a public exposition.\n\nThroughout society, software exists for a wide variety of application domain areas. Each student is required to take at least three courses in a particular application domain, so that RHIT software engineering graduates can more effectively apply the software engineering principles they learn to that domain area. Students can choose from a variety of domain areas, including engineering, scientific and commercial applications.\n\nCourses in various computer science topics such as computer graphics, artificial intelligence, computer networks, computer vision, web-based information systems, and cryptography are among those available as advanced electives. In addition, free elective courses allow students to tailor their undergraduate education to their specific goals.\n\nThe department has its own local area network.

Academic advis ors meet these obligations through applying frameworks for \ngood practice, including building partnerships with pivotal campus offices such as orientation, first -year student \nprograms, and career services.  \n \nAs the NACADA Concept of Academic Advising (NACADA, 2006)  delineates, academic advising objectives differ \namong institutions based upon the particular mission, goals, curriculum, co -curriculum, and assessment methods \nestablished for the respective campus (White, 2000). However, a representative sample of learning outcomes for \nadvising indicates that students will  \n\u2022 craft a coherent educational plan based on assessment of abilities, aspirations, interests, and values;  \n\u2022 use complex information from various sources to set goals, reach decisions, and achieve those goals;  \n\u2022 assume responsibility for meeting academic program requirements;  \n\u2022 articulate the meaning of higher education and the intent of the institution\u2019s curriculum;  \n\u2022 cultivate the intellectual habits that lead to a lifetime of learning; and  \n\u2022 behave as ci tizens who engage in the wider world around them (NACADA, 2006, para. 10).  \n \nThe increasing public attention placed on college completion means increased visibility for academic advising. \nReports such as Guided Pathways to Success  (Complete College America, 2013) point to academic advising as vital to \ndegree completion.  As institutions seek to increase and diversify enrollments, academic advisors are vital to ensuring \nappropriate matriculation and transfer leading to degree complet ion for all students. The evolving manner by which \nstudents complete college degrees, including the blending of courses offered on a variety of campuses and online, \nplaces new challenges on academic advisors, who must possess the tools needed to meet the d emands of students in \nvirtual space and across multiple institutions (Compete College America, 2013).  \n \nA crucial component of the college experience, academic advising encourages students to cultivate meaning in their \nlives, make significant decisions abou t their futures, and access institutional resources. When practiced with \ncompetence and dedication, academic advising is integral to student success, persistence, retention, and completion. Therefore, academic advisors must develop the tools and skills nec essary to address the many issues that influence \nstudent success and do so with respect to the increasing diversity on college and university campuses. The standards and guidelines in the Academic Advising Program Standards provide a framework for developi ng strong academic \nadvising programs.  \n \nReferences, Readings, and Resources  \n \nComplete College America.
