an X below indicates that
the course is required and
must be taken (or note the
Approved Course Substitution below).",Unnamed: 8,"NOTE about ""Elective"" course requirements:  When completing a double major or two degree plan of study, it is not necessary to be specific on any ""Electives"" unless the class to be taken to fill an elective is required for one of the majors.  This will allow you more flexibility in scheduling and avoid the need to later file a revised plan of study.  If a specific course is listed to fulfill an elective, that specific course must then be taken."
