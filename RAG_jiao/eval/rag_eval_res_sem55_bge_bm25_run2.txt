advising appointment, you find out they have not been attending class).

Appreciative Advising (Faculty)
 
Appreciative advising is “the intentional and collaborative practice 
of asking positive, open-ended questions that help students optimize 
their educational experiences and achieve their dreams, goals, and 
potentials” (Bloom, Hutson, and He, 2013, p. 83).

Q: What are some specific examples of how appreciative advising has been shown to enhance students' perception of self-knowledge and academic preparedness?
 This approach is
 grounded in a number of theories, including positive psychology, 
appreciative inquiry, reality therapy, self-worth theory, and social 
constructivism (Bloom, Hutson, & He, 2008).  The authors cite a
 number of studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of appreciative 
advising on GPA and retention rates, along with “enhanced perception of 
self-knowledge, academic preparedness, interdependence, social behavior,
 and confidence” (Bloom, Hutson, & He, 2013, p. 84).

Q: 
What are the six distinct phases of appreciative advising and how do advisors utilize them in their advising sessions according to Bloom, Hutson, and He (2013)?
 There are six distinct phases of appreciative advising:  disarm,
 discover, dream, design, deliver, and don’t settle.  While on the 
surface this appears to be a very formal process, the authors note that,
 “Advisors do not necessarily go through all six phases in each advising
 session nor necessarily employ them sequentially” (Bloom, Hutson, &
 He, 2013, p.

 Disarm  - create a positive first impression; develop trust and rapport 
Discover - learn more about the students through asking positive, open-ended questions 
Dream - focus on the future, try to ascertain the students’ dreams and long-term goals 
Design - assist the student with creating a plan to 
achieve those goals, including the necessary curricular and cocurricular
 experiences 
Deliver - focus on the student implementing their plan; encourage their efforts and assist in navigating obstacles. 
Don’t settle - encourage the student to set high expectations, and to continually review those expectations

have a major role in defining their educational experience. 
Applies to all students (freshmen to seniors; good standing to 
at-risk; decided to undecided majors), thus providing a consistent 
framework across all academic advising venues. 
Allows for individual academic advisor personalities to shine through 
Facilitates the Institute's mission of individual attention and support 
Requires scaffolding, which will be necessary as we help high school students expand their sense of ownership

    advising intervention with an at-risk student that is designed to 
(a) facilitate informed, responsible decision-making, (b) increase

Q: What are the benefits of implementing proactive advising strategies for at-risk and probationary students at Rose-Hulman? 
 140). 
Proactive advising is grounded in student retention literature and 
has documented success with increased GPA (Kirk-Kuwayne & Nishida, 
2001; Molina & Abelman, 2000; Vander Schee, 2007), increased 
retention (Molina & Abelman, 2000), and decreased
    academic dismissal rates (Kirk-Kuwayne & Nashida, 2001).  
Interestingly enough, the research suggests that the effectiveness of 
proactive advising results from intense implementation with at-risk and 
probationary students.  No significant
    differences in success outcomes were found when intrusive advising 
was implemented with general population students (Schwebel, Walburn, 
Klyce, & Jerrolds, 2012).

Challenges
In
working with students over the years, we've discovered that they have been
largely successful in high school by relying on their natural intellect and
ability, which means that most students have insufficient prior experience with
success strategies.  We
also know that students come to campus with an innocent ignorance regarding the
need to implement new strategies, thinking that college will be four more years

Here’s
 a
tip: Make use of your professor’s office hours. The phrase “office 
hours” means
your professor is available for unscheduled student visits. The time is 
reserved for students, so rest assured: You aren’t bothering
your professor when you contact them during office hours. In fact, 
professors
regularly complain that students don’t take advantage of their office 
hours!

 How will you spend 
your time this weekend and in between final exams?  You can’t have 
more than 16 hours in a day
because I know you are reserving 8 hours for sleep, which is the most 
important
success strategy you can adopt. Assign jobs to those remaining 16 hours.
 Eight one-hour study
sessions over two weeks are so much more effective than one eight-hour

or even two four-hour sessions, I promise!!!

Q: 
What disciplines outside of Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Mathematics would benefit from a second major in Data Science and what additional courses would they need to take?
 Data Science (Second Major Only)

Requirements

Data Science is open to all students as a second major; this means that the student will have some other discipline as their primary major.  Students whose primary major is in Computer Science, Software Engineering or Mathematics will find the Data Science program the easiest since there is considerable overlap between those programs and the Data Science requirements  Students from other disciplines are also encouraged to participate, but will have to take more courses.  
Top 1 hits: False
Top 3 hits: False

Q: What is the credit hour requirement for a Data Science major and how many of those credit hours can be used to fulfill requirements for another major or minor?
 All students are encouraged to take the individual courses in the program, regardless of whether they wish to fulfill the second major requirements.

Data Science requires 72 course credit hours and a senior capstone experience; these include 36 hours of Fundamental data science topics, 20 hours in Advanced topics, and 16 hours in Electives.  The 36 fundamental credit hours and no more than 8 of the elective credit hours may be used to satisfy any requirements for another major (primary or secondary) or minor; students with a second major in Data Science cannot earn a minor in Data Science as well.  Thus, the 20 Advanced credit hours and at least 8 Elective credit hours can only be used to satisfy technical and free electives of another major program.

Furthermore, Data Science majors are expected to complete a Senior Project or Senior Thesis in either their primary major or within either the Computer Science and Software Engineering Department or the Mathematics Department, and that this work includes a data science component.

Q: What is the significance of the "eligible to begin in" distinction on a student's transcript and how does it impact their credit for future courses?
 What does "eligible to begin in" mean on a student's transcript?
You may see a line on a student's transcript that looks like this:
        From Credit By Exam
        SPAN 112EL  Eligible to Begin in SPAN L112   0 CrHrs
This means that the student will get credit for SPAN111 upon completing SPAN112 with a grade of C or higher.
Another example:
        From AP - Advanced Placement Credit
        CSSE 220EL  Eligible to Begin in CSSE220   0 CrHrs
This means that the student will get credit for CSSE120 upon completing CSSE220 with a grade of D or higher. Note:

Q: What are the new courses being introduced and how do they differ from the courses they are replacing? 
 We
 are replacing the courses MA211 Differential Equations and MA212 Matrix
 Algebra & Systems of Differential Equations with two new courses:
MA221 Matrix Algebra and Differential Equations I
MA222 Matrix Algebra and Differential Equations II
These
 courses rearrange and amend the topics currently covered in MA211 and 
MA212, and they must be taken in numerical order, as MA221 is a 
prerequisite for MA222.  Every major program of study will accept 
MA221 as a substitute for MA212, and those majors that require both 
MA211 and MA212 will also accept MA222 as a substitute for MA211.

Top 1 hits: False

Q: What are the options for students who have taken MA211 but not MA212?
 MA211
 will not be offered after the summer 2020 term, while MA212 will be 
offered in both the summer 2020 and fall 2020 terms, with preference in 
the fall 2020 term given to students who are expected to have credit for
 MA211 by the end of the summer 2020 term.  Thus,
If you
 have not previously taken either MA211 or MA212 and expect to earn 
credit for MA113 by the beginning of Fall 2020, you should register for 
MA221.  If you are interested in taken either MA211 or MA212 this 
summer, please contact me to ensure you are taking the correct course.
If you have taken (or are taking) MA212 but have not taken MA211, you have the following options available:Take MA211 this summer as an online course.
Take MA221, which will count as a substitution for MA211.
If you have taken (or are taking) MA211 but have not taken MA212, you should utilize one of the following options:Take MA212 this summer as an online course.
Take MA212 this fall – we will preregister you for the course.
If
 you are seeking to grade replace either MA211 or MA212, you can use 
MA221 instead.  If you are looking to grade replace both MA211 and 
MA212, you would then need to retake both MA221 and MA222.

Q: What is the purpose of the pre-req waiver in relation to avoiding potential issues between a student and Physics II instructor, and is this process applicable to athletes who drop to part-time status?
 If the student
and faculty member are okay with the situation, a pre-req waiver can be completed
and filed.  The student can then enroll in Physics II.  Looking at
the history of this situation, sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. 
So the purpose of the pre-req is to force a discussion to happen between the
student and Physics II instructor to try to avoid a bad situation, which
sometimes happens anyway.

Q: What should you do if a parent requests a letter of recommendation for their child to a graduate school, according to the general rule of thumb mentioned in the content?
 While
 it's hard to visualize all the different scenarios this might 
encompass, a general rule of thumb would be to act when requested by the
 student.
For example, if a parent calls and wants you to send a 
letter of recommendation to a graduate school, you can let the parents 
know that you will attempt to speak to their son/daughter about 
this.  If the student agrees with the idea, you are free to send 
the letter.  Do not send the letter without permission from the 
student; to do so would be a FERPA violation.
Emergency Situations: 
 If a parent calls because they are concerned about the safety of their 
child, please call Public Safety (x8590) right away, rather than waiting
 until you can talk with the student.

 completed a FERPA form giving Rose-Hulman permission to do so.

Q: What is Rose-Hulman's approach to providing students with a broad liberal education and how does it differ from traditional general education programs at other institutions?
 General Education

As a specialized institution with a focus on science, engineering, and mathematics, Rose-Hulman approaches Institute-wide general education differently than most schools. In fact, we seldom use the term “general education,” although our programs still seek to provide each student with a broad liberal education that complements their technical disciplines.


Top 1 hits: False
Top 3 hits: True

Q: 
"What are the requirements for completing a general education program at Rose-Hulman, and how does the institute ensure student learning within these areas?"
 Each student will complete, as a part of their program, at least 36 credit hours in the humanities, social sciences, and arts (HSSA). Additionally, due to the technical nature of our programs, students will complete over 35 credit hours of foundational math and science courses. Students will also complete RHIT 100 – Foundations for Rose-Hulman Success.

In total, this equates to 72 credit hours (54 equivalent semester credit hours) of what would typically be included in a general education program. Student learning is systematically reviewed as part of Rose-Hulman’s assessment and continuous improvement practices at both the institute and program levels.

Freshman advisors,
First of all, the short answer:
Before last year’s curriculum change, the ﬁrst-year wri�ng requirement at Rose was RH131, plain and simple. With the
curriculum change, that requirement is sa�sﬁed by the Rose First-Year Wri�ng Seminar (HUM H190), or by transfer
of English Composi�on ENGL H100.

Q: 
What are the new course descriptions for ENGL H1xx and why is this substitution being handled differently for transfer credits in regards to HUM H190?
 (HUM H190 is the requirement, but ENGL H100 is a standard subs�tu�on.) If a
student receives ENGL H1xx instead, that counts as an HSSA elec�ve.
To clarify this a bit further, I’m including the new course descrip�ons and the explana�on of why we’re handling things
this way when it comes to transfer credit.

Q: 
What are the special requirements for students who elect to take a modern language and how many credits can be counted towards HSSA requirements?
 Technical and Professional Communication is a requirement for most majors, and counts toward the total requirement of 9 HSSA courses.

Modern Language

Students who elect to take a modern language should note the following special requirements:

A minimum of two terms of the same language (or the equivalent thereof) must be completed in order to apply modern language credits toward Humanities and Social Sciences requirements. If only SPAN L111, JAPN L111 or GER L111 is completed, that course will not be allowed to satisfy an HSSA requirement.  For transfer credit, a single modern language course at 4 credit hours may be used to satisfy an HSSA requirement if it is higher than the entry level course (L111) in that language. Example: Transfer credit awarded for SPAN L113 could be used to satisfy one HSSA course requirement.

HSSA credit will not be awarded for a lower-level language course until the student takes and passes the next course in the language sequence with a grade of C or better.

No more than 16 credits of modern language may be counted toward HSSA requirements.

Students may not earn modern language credit in their native languages.

Note: Students planning to study abroad should be sure to have their program approved ahead of time by the head of the HSSA Department and by the head of the Department in which they are majoring.

Q: How do mathematicians and mathematically educated professionals contribute to advancements in science, technology, and decision-making in various industries?
 Complex economic and planning decisions, scientific discoveries that improve our lives, and new technologies and products are often possible only after mathematical or statistical analysis, or a computer visualization, simulation, design and implementation based on mathematics. Therefore, mathematicians, as well as mathematically educated scientists, engineers and economists, make important daily contributions in the understanding and advancement of science, the improvement and discovery of new technology, and decision-making and planning in business, industry and government. Students interested in using their mathematical skills in solving real world problems are well prepared, by majoring or minoring in mathematics, for careers such as in the insurance industry, software design, data and systems analysis, scientific computing, combustion research, the animated movie industry, and cryptanalysis to name a few, or a graduate degree in a related technical field. Those students with a very strong interest in mathematics itself can pursue graduate study in mathematics in preparation for careers as university or college mathematics teachers and in the development of new mathematical and statistical concepts and methods as researchers in academia, government and industry.

Q: 
What are the key principles of software engineering and how do they contribute to the development of reliable software? 
 Software Engineering

Software engineering is the creation of software using a process similar to other engineering disciplines. It allows for software to be reliable and developed within time and cost estimates. 
Top 1 hits: False
Top 3 hits: True

Q: 
What courses are included in the software engineering curriculum to prepare students for a career in reliable and economical software development?
 The software engineering curriculum prepares students for a career in reliable, economical software development.

Programming is only one phase (construction) of software engineering. There are many other aspects of the software engineering process, such as requirements definition, architectural design, and quality assurance, which need to be applied in order to develop reliable software on time and within budget constraints. The software engineering curriculum provides students a solid background in both the theory and practice of all phases in the software engineering process, beginning with their first course of study in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, and continuing to the end of the senior year.

Since software is a non-physical product developed and executed on computers, the software engineering curriculum has computer science as its primary engineering science. The computer science courses taken by software engineering majors include the study of algorithms, data structures, database concepts, computer architecture, programming languages and operating systems. Software engineering majors also complete important courses in other closely related fields, such as discrete mathematics, digital logic design, and engineering statistics.

Q: What are the differences between the Master of Science and Master of Mechanical Engineering programs offered in the Department of Mechanical Engineering?
 Mechanical Engineering

Graduate Studies – Mechanical Engineering

These programs have been designed to build upon a student’s undergraduate background and provide additional depth and breadth in the challenging and versatile profession of Mechanical Engineering. The department offers two graduate path alternatives. The Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering (MSME) degree program is a traditional thesis-based approach whereby the student pursues both research and course work culminating in the preparation and oral defense of a written thesis. The Master of Mechanical Engineering (MME) degree is a course-based master’s program, which requires additional coursework in lieu of a traditional thesis.

The objective of both programs, the Master of Mechanical Engineering and Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering, is to prepare graduates for early career advancement in the field of Mechanical Engineering by building upon their undergraduate training with advanced coursework and concentrated study of problems and topics relevant to the field.

Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering (MSME)
