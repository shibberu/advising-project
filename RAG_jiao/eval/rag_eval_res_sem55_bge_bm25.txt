taking while promoting a growth mindset.

Communicating via text messages
Letting 
your advisees know that even though they do not like email, it will be 
important for them to check their email on a regular basis as that is 
the main way faculty and staff will contact them.  You might also 
consider asking your
                advisees for their cell phone numbers and permission to 
text them should the need arise (e.g., they do not show up for an 
advising appointment, you find out they have not been attending class).
Used to their family being a support group

Appreciative advising is “the intentional and collaborative practice

Q: 460)

What are some specific ways in which appreciative advising has been shown to improve academic success and personal growth, according to the studies cited by Bloom, Hutson, and He (2008)?
 This approach is
 grounded in a number of theories, including positive psychology, 
appreciative inquiry, reality therapy, self-worth theory, and social 
constructivism (Bloom, Hutson, & He, 2008).  The authors cite a
 number of studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of appreciative 
advising on GPA and retention rates, along with “enhanced perception of 
self-knowledge, academic preparedness, interdependence, social behavior,
 and confidence” (Bloom, Hutson, & He, 2013, p.

Q: 
What are the six distinct phases of appreciative advising and how are they typically used by advisors during advising sessions?
 There are six distinct phases of appreciative advising:  disarm,
 discover, dream, design, deliver, and don’t settle.  While on the 
surface this appears to be a very formal process, the authors note that,
 “Advisors do not necessarily go through all six phases in each advising
 session nor necessarily employ them sequentially” (Bloom, Hutson, &
 He, 2013, p.

achieve those goals, including the necessary curricular and cocurricular
 experiences 
Deliver - focus on the student implementing their plan; encourage their efforts and assist in navigating obstacles. 
Don’t settle - encourage the student to set high expectations, and to continually review those expectations

 140). 
Proactive advising is grounded in student retention literature and 
has documented success with increased GPA (Kirk-Kuwayne & Nishida, 
2001; Molina & Abelman, 2000; Vander Schee, 2007), increased 
retention (Molina & Abelman, 2000), and decreased
    academic dismissal rates (Kirk-Kuwayne & Nashida, 2001).  
Interestingly enough, the research suggests that the effectiveness of 
proactive advising results from intense implementation with at-risk and 
probationary students.  No significant
    differences in success outcomes were found when intrusive advising 
was implemented with general population students (Schwebel, Walburn, 
Klyce, & Jerrolds, 2012).

In
working with students over the years, we've discovered that they have been
largely successful in high school by relying on their natural intellect and
ability, which means that most students have insufficient prior experience with
success strategies.  We
also know that students come to campus with an innocent ignorance regarding the
need to implement new strategies, thinking that college will be four more years

Given their expectations, many first-year students

your professor is available for unscheduled student visits. The time is

professors
regularly complain that students don’t take advantage of their office

What are some potential consequences of first-year students prioritizing the upcoming Career Fair over their academic responsibilities?
 Challenges
With
 the upcoming Career Fair, many first-year students will put academics 
on hold in order to prepare, convinced that everyone will receive an 
internship offer.  While the fall Career Fair is invaluable to 
seniors who are looking for full-time jobs, freshmen tend to overrate 
the importance of attending.

Advising
 appointments will begin next week.

Q: "What are some tips for making the most out of attending a Career Fair?"

on and on. Especially for introverts, the whole thing can be overwhelming.

Q: 
What majors are recommended for students who want to pursue Data Science as a second major?
 Data Science (Second Major Only)

Requirements

Data Science is open to all students as a second major; this means that the student will have some other discipline as their primary major.  Students whose primary major is in Computer Science, Software Engineering or Mathematics will find the Data Science program the easiest since there is considerable overlap between those programs and the Data Science requirements  Students from other disciplines are also encouraged to participate, but will have to take more courses.

Top 3 hits: False

Q: 
How many credit hours must a student complete in order to fulfill the requirements for a second major in Data Science?
 All students are encouraged to take the individual courses in the program, regardless of whether they wish to fulfill the second major requirements.

Data Science requires 72 course credit hours and a senior capstone experience; these include 36 hours of Fundamental data science topics, 20 hours in Advanced topics, and 16 hours in Electives.  The 36 fundamental credit hours and no more than 8 of the elective credit hours may be used to satisfy any requirements for another major (primary or secondary) or minor; students with a second major in Data Science cannot earn a minor in Data Science as well.  Thus, the 20 Advanced credit hours and at least 8 Elective credit hours can only be used to satisfy technical and free electives of another major program.

Furthermore, Data Science majors are expected to complete a Senior Project or Senior Thesis in either their primary major or within either the Computer Science and Software Engineering Department or the Mathematics Department, and that this work includes a data science component.

Q: What courses can a student receive credit for after completing SPAN112 with a grade of C or higher, based on the information given in the transcript?
 What does "eligible to begin in" mean on a student's transcript?
You may see a line on a student's transcript that looks like this:
        From Credit By Exam
        SPAN 112EL  Eligible to Begin in SPAN L112   0 CrHrs
This means that the student will get credit for SPAN111 upon completing SPAN112 with a grade of C or higher.
Another example:
        From AP - Advanced Placement Credit
        CSSE 220EL  Eligible to Begin in CSSE220   0 CrHrs
This means that the student will get credit for CSSE120 upon completing CSSE220 with a grade of D or higher. Note:
 While the student would get credit for CSSE120, in this example, the 
student cannot proceed to CSSE230 unless they get a grade of C or

A student must have a particular class or classes this quarter to graduate on time, and only one or two combinations work
A student was/will be on co-op/study abroad so must get into particular courses
A student genuinely only has one schedule that works
Scenarios Not Appropriate for Pre-Registration

Q: 
What is the purpose of software engineering and how does it differ from other engineering disciplines?
 Software Engineering

Software engineering is the creation of software using a process similar to other engineering disciplines. It allows for software to be reliable and developed within time and cost estimates. 
Top 1 hits: True
Top 3 hits: True

Q: What courses are included in the software engineering curriculum and how do they prepare students for a career in software development? 
 The software engineering curriculum prepares students for a career in reliable, economical software development.

Programming is only one phase (construction) of software engineering. There are many other aspects of the software engineering process, such as requirements definition, architectural design, and quality assurance, which need to be applied in order to develop reliable software on time and within budget constraints. The software engineering curriculum provides students a solid background in both the theory and practice of all phases in the software engineering process, beginning with their first course of study in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, and continuing to the end of the senior year.

Since software is a non-physical product developed and executed on computers, the software engineering curriculum has computer science as its primary engineering science. The computer science courses taken by software engineering majors include the study of algorithms, data structures, database concepts, computer architecture, programming languages and operating systems. Software engineering majors also complete important courses in other closely related fields, such as discrete mathematics, digital logic design, and engineering statistics.
