your advisees know that even though they do not like email, it will be 
important for them to check their email on a regular basis as that is 
the main way faculty and staff will contact them.  You might also 
consider asking your

text them should the need arise (e.g., they do not show up for an 
advising appointment, you find out they have not been attending class).

What are some key theories that support the effectiveness of appreciative advising, and how have studies shown its impact on academic success and personal development?
 This approach is
 grounded in a number of theories, including positive psychology, 
appreciative inquiry, reality therapy, self-worth theory, and social 
constructivism (Bloom, Hutson, & He, 2008).  The authors cite a
 number of studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of appreciative 
advising on GPA and retention rates, along with “enhanced perception of 
self-knowledge, academic preparedness, interdependence, social behavior,
 and confidence” (Bloom, Hutson, & He, 2013, p.

 session nor necessarily employ them sequentially” (Bloom, Hutson, &
 He, 2013, p.

Q: 
What strategies can be implemented to promote proactive and intrusive advising in order to raise the bar of expectations for student academic success?
 If you were going to raise your own internal bar of expectations, what would that mean?
Proactive Advising (Student Academic Success)
Earl (1988) defined intrusive advising as “deliberate structured 
student intervention at the first indication of academic difficulty in 
order to motivate a student to seek help” (p. 28).

(a) facilitate informed, responsible decision-making, (b) increase 
student motivation towards activities in his/her social/academic 
community, and (c) ensure the probability of the

Q: 
"What strategies and resources have proven to be effective in proactive advising for at-risk and probationary students at Rose-Hulman?"
 140). 
Proactive advising is grounded in student retention literature and 
has documented success with increased GPA (Kirk-Kuwayne & Nishida, 
2001; Molina & Abelman, 2000; Vander Schee, 2007), increased 
retention (Molina & Abelman, 2000), and decreased
    academic dismissal rates (Kirk-Kuwayne & Nashida, 2001).  
Interestingly enough, the research suggests that the effectiveness of 
proactive advising results from intense implementation with at-risk and 
probationary students.  No significant
    differences in success outcomes were found when intrusive advising 
was implemented with general population students (Schwebel, Walburn, 
Klyce, & Jerrolds, 2012).

In
working with students over the years, we've discovered that they have been
largely successful in high school by relying on their natural intellect and
ability, which means that most students have insufficient prior experience with
success strategies.  We
also know that students come to campus with an innocent ignorance regarding the
need to implement new strategies, thinking that college will be four more years
of the same
Given their expectations, many first-year students
 will find themselves behind in courses already.

Tips from Your Advisor Sample Email Text:
Here’s
 a
tip: Make use of your professor’s office hours. The phrase “office 
hours” means
your professor is available for unscheduled student visits. The time is 
reserved for students, so rest assured: You aren’t bothering
your professor when you contact them during office hours. In fact, 
professors
regularly complain that students don’t take advantage of their office 
hours!
To make your
visit or call or chat effective, formulate to the best of your ability the

Q: 
"What advice would you give to first-year students who are considering putting academics on hold to prepare for the upcoming Career Fair?"
 Challenges
With
 the upcoming Career Fair, many first-year students will put academics 
on hold in order to prepare, convinced that everyone will receive an 
internship offer.  While the fall Career Fair is invaluable to 
seniors who are looking for full-time jobs, freshmen tend to overrate 
the importance of attending.

Q:

 How will you spend 
your time this weekend and in between final exams?  You can’t have 
more than 16 hours in a day
because I know you are reserving 8 hours for sleep, which is the most 
important
success strategy you can adopt. Assign jobs to those remaining 16 hours.
 Eight one-hour study
sessions over two weeks are so much more effective than one eight-hour 
session,

Q: 
What are the recommended primary majors for students pursuing Data Science as a second major?
 Data Science (Second Major Only)

Requirements

Data Science is open to all students as a second major; this means that the student will have some other discipline as their primary major.  Students whose primary major is in Computer Science, Software Engineering or Mathematics will find the Data Science program the easiest since there is considerable overlap between those programs and the Data Science requirements  Students from other disciplines are also encouraged to participate, but will have to take more courses.

Q: 
What are the requirements for the Senior Project or Senior Thesis for Data Science majors and where can they complete this component?
 All students are encouraged to take the individual courses in the program, regardless of whether they wish to fulfill the second major requirements.

Data Science requires 72 course credit hours and a senior capstone experience; these include 36 hours of Fundamental data science topics, 20 hours in Advanced topics, and 16 hours in Electives.  The 36 fundamental credit hours and no more than 8 of the elective credit hours may be used to satisfy any requirements for another major (primary or secondary) or minor; students with a second major in Data Science cannot earn a minor in Data Science as well.  Thus, the 20 Advanced credit hours and at least 8 Elective credit hours can only be used to satisfy technical and free electives of another major program.

Furthermore, Data Science majors are expected to complete a Senior Project or Senior Thesis in either their primary major or within either the Computer Science and Software Engineering Department or the Mathematics Department, and that this work includes a data science component.

Q: What is the significance of the "eligible to begin in" notation on a student's transcript and how does it impact their credit for a particular course?
 What does "eligible to begin in" mean on a student's transcript?
You may see a line on a student's transcript that looks like this:
        From Credit By Exam
        SPAN 112EL  Eligible to Begin in SPAN L112   0 CrHrs
This means that the student will get credit for SPAN111 upon completing SPAN112 with a grade of C or higher.
Another example:
        From AP - Advanced Placement Credit
        CSSE 220EL  Eligible to Begin in CSSE220   0 CrHrs
This means that the student will get credit for CSSE120 upon completing CSSE220 with a grade of D or higher. Note:
 While the student would get credit for CSSE120, in this example, the 
student cannot proceed to CSSE230 unless they get a grade of C or

Q: What are the new courses that are replacing MA211 and MA212, and what changes have been made to the topics covered in these courses?
 We
 are replacing the courses MA211 Differential Equations and MA212 Matrix
 Algebra & Systems of Differential Equations with two new courses:
MA221 Matrix Algebra and Differential Equations I
MA222 Matrix Algebra and Differential Equations II
These
 courses rearrange and amend the topics currently covered in MA211 and 
MA212, and they must be taken in numerical order, as MA221 is a 
prerequisite for MA222.  Every major program of study will accept 
MA221 as a substitute for MA212, and those majors that require both 
MA211 and MA212 will also accept MA222 as a substitute for MA211.

the fall 2020 term given to students who are expected to have credit for
 MA211 by the end of the summer 2020 term.  Thus,
If you
 have not previously taken either MA211 or MA212 and expect to earn 
credit for MA113 by the beginning of Fall 2020, you should register for 
MA221.  If you are interested in taken either MA211 or MA212 this

Top 1 hits: False
Top 3 hits: False

Q: 
How do mathematicians contribute to the advancement of science, technology, and decision-making in various industries and government?
 Complex economic and planning decisions, scientific discoveries that improve our lives, and new technologies and products are often possible only after mathematical or statistical analysis, or a computer visualization, simulation, design and implementation based on mathematics. Therefore, mathematicians, as well as mathematically educated scientists, engineers and economists, make important daily contributions in the understanding and advancement of science, the improvement and discovery of new technology, and decision-making and planning in business, industry and government. Students interested in using their mathematical skills in solving real world problems are well prepared, by majoring or minoring in mathematics, for careers such as in the insurance industry, software design, data and systems analysis, scientific computing, combustion research, the animated movie industry, and cryptanalysis to name a few, or a graduate degree in a related technical field. Those students with a very strong interest in mathematics itself can pursue graduate study in mathematics in preparation for careers as university or college mathematics teachers and in the development of new mathematical and statistical concepts and methods as researchers in academia, government and industry.

Q: What is the process used in software engineering to ensure reliable and timely development of software? 
 Software Engineering

Software engineering is the creation of software using a process similar to other engineering disciplines. It allows for software to be reliable and developed within time and cost estimates. 
Top 1 hits: False
Top 3 hits: True

Q: What courses are included in the software engineering curriculum to prepare students for a career in reliable, economical software development?
 The software engineering curriculum prepares students for a career in reliable, economical software development.

Programming is only one phase (construction) of software engineering. There are many other aspects of the software engineering process, such as requirements definition, architectural design, and quality assurance, which need to be applied in order to develop reliable software on time and within budget constraints. The software engineering curriculum provides students a solid background in both the theory and practice of all phases in the software engineering process, beginning with their first course of study in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, and continuing to the end of the senior year.

Since software is a non-physical product developed and executed on computers, the software engineering curriculum has computer science as its primary engineering science. The computer science courses taken by software engineering majors include the study of algorithms, data structures, database concepts, computer architecture, programming languages and operating systems. Software engineering majors also complete important courses in other closely related fields, such as discrete mathematics, digital logic design, and engineering statistics.
