Generation Z
Characteristics of Generation Z and Suggestions for Advisors
Members of Generation Z* are:
As an academic advisor, consider:
Digital natives
Leveraging Moodle to house important advising information and using the scheduler activity to set up advising appointments.
Craving face-to-face interactions
Making sure your advisees know when you are available to meet with them in person (the academic advising syllabus
 is a great place to provide this information), and explaining to them 
that all faculty have office hours where they can stop
                by and have a conversation.

Q: What strategies can be used to help Rose-Hulman students incorporate movement and exercise into their daily schedules?
 Be patient with your 
advisees.  Their abundant use of technology means their 
interpersonal skills may be lacking.
Responsible
Reminding
 your advisees that their success is dependent upon the amount of effort
 they choose to expend; helping them to understand what effort is 
necessary to be successful at Rose-Hulman; and guiding them in the 
creation of a plan to be
                successful.
            
Sedentary
Encouraging
 your advisees to incorporate movement (exercise) into their daily 
schedules.  This is important for their overall health as well as 
their ability to learn.
Motivated by earning credit or advancement
Guiding 
your advisees towards experiences that will enable them to learn 
specialized skills that could either (a) give them credit towards 
graduation or (b) help them to advance in their future career.
Used to 24/7 access
Setting 
boundaries and appropriate expectations with your advisees regarding 
when you will or will not be available.  Consider adding this 
information to your academic advising syllabus.
Risk Averse
While 
the idea of risk taking may apply more to a sense of danger in their 
physical and online environments, it may transfer to the context of 
learning.  Your advisees may avoid challenging projects, courses, 
or majors so as not to fail.
                Reminding your advisees that failure is an important 
part of the learning process can help them ease into necessary risk 
taking while promoting a growth mindset.
Financially conservative
Reminding
 your advisees that they have invested a great deal in campus resources,
 and that they should get a return on their investment.  If your 
advisees have low midterm grades, consider reminding them how much it 
costs to repeat a
                course.
            
Communicating via text messages
Letting 
your advisees know that even though they do not like email, it will be 
important for them to check their email on a regular basis as that is 
the main way faculty and staff will contact them.  You might also 
consider asking your
                advisees for their cell phone numbers and permission to 
text them should the need arise (e.g., they do not show up for an 
advising appointment, you find out they have not been attending class).
Used to their family being a support group
Encouraging
 your advisees to identify a support structure on campus (e.g., 
roommate, friends, classmates, advisor, other campus resources).
Planning to change the world
Providing
 more details about how careers in science, engineering, and mathematics
 can make contributions to the world and solve the grand 
challenges.  Also consider highlighting some of the social change 
opportunities available to them,
                such as Engineers without Borders, Engineers for a 
Sustainable World, and Habitat for Humanity.
Familiar with a strengths-based approach to life and leadership
Spending time with your advisees in the Discover phase of Appreciative Advising to help reinforce and/or identify their strengths.

Q: 
What advice would you give to advisees who have reported studying 10 or fewer hours per week in high school, but are now part of the Fall 2023 First-Year Cohort which consists of students with a 3.75 or higher high school GPA?
 Report studying 10 or fewer hours per week in high school.
Reminding
 your advisees that expectations for college are different from high 
school.  As noted in the RHIT100 text, "the one who does the work 
does the learning" (Doyle & Zakrajsek, 2018, p. 164).
Seek assistance from other students before seeking assistance from faculty.
Pointing
 out that they have invested a great deal of money in our campus 
resources.  They should get a return on that investment.
Not have encountered significant challenges and will not have had to ask for help.
Reminding
 students that it is normal to struggle.  Rose-Hulman will 
intentionally challenge them to help them realize their potential, but 
we will support them through the process.
Have been academically successful relying on only low-level learning strategies, namely memorization.
Encouraging students to review the learning cycle strategies found in the RHIT100 Moodle course.
Earn their first B (or lower) during their first term.
Pointing
 out a couple of facts: (1) less than 10 students each year will 
graduate with a 4.0 GPA and (2) 98% of our students get placed in a 
career, graduate school, or the military.  Perfect grades are not 
expected nor are they necessary.
Fall 2023 First-Year Cohort
Characteristics of the Fall 2023 First-Year Cohort and Suggestions for Advisors
Of the Fall 2023 first-year cohort:
As an academic advisor, consider:
76% had a 3.75 or higher high school GPA
Reminding
 your advisees that "what got you here won't get you there."  
Success in high school came very easily; that won't be the case at 
Rose-Hulman.

Q: What resources can advisees take advantage of on campus to support their academic and personal success, such as the Society for Women Engineers or the LEAD program? 
 While that
 is a great starting point, they'll need more than that to get through 
their degree program. 
                 
46% are from Indiana and Illinois
Finding commonalities with your advisees regarding places you enjoy visiting.
22% are female
Encouraging
 your advisees to take advantage of specific resources on campus, such 
as the Society for Women Engineers or the LEAD program.  You might 
also encourage them to talk to the female faculty in their department so
 that they have
                role models of successful female 
engineers/mathematicians/scientists.  Finally, help female students
 understand that they do not have to conform to traditional female roles
 (e.g., always being the secretary for a group project).
15% are first-generation
Avoiding
 using college jargon and acronyms with your advisees; encouraging your 
advisees to ask lots of questions; and reminding your advisees that 
there several offices on campus ready and willing to support 
them.  
8% are international students
Encouraging
 them to interact with domestic students so that they can further 
develop their English language skills.  If they are struggling with
 the language, encourage them to seek ESL tutoring.  Schedules can 
be found HERE.

Questions to Ask Your Advisees and Suggestions for Advisors
Is your advisee:
If so, consider:
A first-generation student?
Checking
 in with your advisee more often to ask how the transition is really 
going.  Make sure to explain any college jargon or acronyms you 
use.
A 21st Century Scholar?
Reminding your advisee about all of the resources that Rose-Hulman makes available to students (see Student Support Services section for more details).
Entering with enough credits to graduate early?
Asking your advisee to consider a double major, minor, study abroad, or co-op.  There are degree program presentations that students can watch to get
                a sense of what might compliment their primary major.
A legacy student?
Questioning
 your advisee about his/her expectations.  You may need to guide 
them toward more realistic expectations, depending on how long ago their
 grandparent/parent/sibling graduated.  
From more than one state away from Indiana?
Encouraging
 your advisee to develop a friend group, join a club or organization, or
 take steps to create a support group.  Sometimes students end up 
being homesick, and if they do not have a support group, it can cause 
academic and emotional
                issues.

Q: (2008). The appreciative advising revolution. Champaign, IL: Stipes.

What are the six phases of appreciative advising and how do they contribute to the effectiveness of this approach in academic advising?
 Locate pertinent information, policies, and procedures for planning purposes.
Appreciative Advising (Faculty)
 
Appreciative advising is “the intentional and collaborative practice 
of asking positive, open-ended questions that help students optimize 
their educational experiences and achieve their dreams, goals, and 
potentials” (Bloom, Hutson, and He, 2013, p. 83).  This approach is
 grounded in a number of theories, including positive psychology, 
appreciative inquiry, reality therapy, self-worth theory, and social 
constructivism (Bloom, Hutson, & He, 2008).  The authors cite a
 number of studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of appreciative 
advising on GPA and retention rates, along with “enhanced perception of 
self-knowledge, academic preparedness, interdependence, social behavior,
 and confidence” (Bloom, Hutson, & He, 2013, p. 84).
There are six distinct phases of appreciative advising:  disarm,
 discover, dream, design, deliver, and don’t settle.  While on the 
surface this appears to be a very formal process, the authors note that,
 “Advisors do not necessarily go through all six phases in each advising
 session nor necessarily employ them sequentially” (Bloom, Hutson, &
 He, 2013, p. 85). 
Disarm  - create a positive first impression; develop trust and rapport 
Discover - learn more about the students through asking positive, open-ended questions 
Dream - focus on the future, try to ascertain the students’ dreams and long-term goals 
Design - assist the student with creating a plan to 
achieve those goals, including the necessary curricular and cocurricular
 experiences 
Deliver - focus on the student implementing their plan; encourage their efforts and assist in navigating obstacles. 
Don’t settle - encourage the student to set high expectations, and to continually review those expectations
Appreciative advising has an appeal for Rose-Hulman for a number of reasons. 
Promotes quality interactions with students, fostering a deeper 
relationship, rather than merely facilitating course scheduling (i.e., 
moving away from transactional experiences). 
Aligns with the Academic Master Plan 10 year goal for students to 
have a major role in defining their educational experience. 
Applies to all students (freshmen to seniors; good standing to 
at-risk; decided to undecided majors), thus providing a consistent 
framework across all academic advising venues. 
Allows for individual academic advisor personalities to shine through 
Facilitates the Institute's mission of individual attention and support 
Requires scaffolding, which will be necessary as we help high school students expand their sense of ownership

Q: Question: How can proactive advising, as defined by Varney and implemented at Rose-Hulman, positively impact the academic success of at-risk and probationary students?
 If you were going to raise your own internal bar of expectations, what would that mean?
Proactive Advising (Student Academic Success)
Earl (1988) defined intrusive advising as “deliberate structured 
student intervention at the first indication of academic difficulty in 
order to motivate a student to seek help” (p. 28).  Heisserer and 
Parette (2002) expanded this idea as an “intensive
    advising intervention with an at-risk student that is designed to 
(a) facilitate informed, responsible decision-making, (b) increase 
student motivation towards activities in his/her social/academic 
community, and (c) ensure the probability of the
    student’s academic success” (p. 74).  Varney (2013) noted that,
 “Proactive advising involves intentional interactions with students 
before a negative situation cannot be ameliorated” (p. 140). 
Proactive advising is grounded in student retention literature and 
has documented success with increased GPA (Kirk-Kuwayne & Nishida, 
2001; Molina & Abelman, 2000; Vander Schee, 2007), increased 
retention (Molina & Abelman, 2000), and decreased
    academic dismissal rates (Kirk-Kuwayne & Nashida, 2001).  
Interestingly enough, the research suggests that the effectiveness of 
proactive advising results from intense implementation with at-risk and 
probationary students.  No significant
    differences in success outcomes were found when intrusive advising 
was implemented with general population students (Schwebel, Walburn, 
Klyce, & Jerrolds, 2012).

In
 this Moodle book, you'll find a weekly breakdown of the quarter as it 
pertains to academic advising and your advisees.  Each week will 
include the following sections:
Academic Calendar
In this section, you'll find pertinent dates from the academic calendar.
Challenges
In
 this section, you'll find information regarding some of the common 
challenges students face around this time.  While this section will
 be especially pertinent for first-year students, there are plenty of 
upperclassmen who have not yet mastered the necessary skills for success
 at Rose-Hulman.
Resources
In
 this section, you'll find resources to help students with the above 
challenges.

Q: What resources are available for students who struggle with test anxiety?

 Also included will be sample email text that you can 
send to your advisees to engage with them proactively (thanks to Ella 
Ingram for sharing this idea).
Week 1
Academic Calendar
Fall Quarter: 
Classes begin on Thursday (Week 0)
Final date to add a class is the following Wednesday
Winter & Spring Quarter:  
Classes begin on Monday
Final date to add a class is that Friday 
Challenges
Schedules and room assignments can change up to the last minute; finding rooms can also be frustrating.
Resources
Tips from Your Advisor Sample Email Text:
Here’s
 a tip: Check your room assignments first thing tomorrow morning. Every 
once in a while things change right up to the last minute. It can catch 
people off guard when you show up to class and it’s the wrong room. Best
 to be prepared with one last check of Schedule Lookup.  If time permits, walk through your class schedule to ensure that you know where you are going.  The Where's My Class Map can be a helpful tool for interpreting your schedule and navigating the academic buildings.
Week 2
Academic Calendar
No academic calendar activities this week
Challenges
In
working with students over the years, we've discovered that they have been
largely successful in high school by relying on their natural intellect and
ability, which means that most students have insufficient prior experience with
success strategies.  We
also know that students come to campus with an innocent ignorance regarding the
need to implement new strategies, thinking that college will be four more years
of the same
Given their expectations, many first-year students
 will find themselves behind in courses already.  Some of our 
upperclassmen may not have transitioned from break back into school mode
 yet, and may also find themselves behind.    
Resources
Tips from Your Advisor Sample Email Text:
Here's a tip: Map out all of your responsibilities this quarter in one place using a quarter calendar. 
 Using your course syllabi, write down due dates for homework, quizzes, 
exams, papers, projects, presentations, etc.  This ensures that 
nothing is forgotten.  (Just because most assignments fit a pattern
 doesn't mean that all assignments will!)  In addition, you'll be 
able to see what you need to focus on each week (short-term), as well as
 the bigger upcoming assessments (long-term).  
Week 3
Academic Calendar
No academic calendar activities this week
Challenges
For
 many students, their first round of exams will occur this week.  
First-year students are less likely to spend adequate time preparing, 
given their high school experiences.  In addition, first-year 
students as well as upperclassmen often expect the exam to be comprised 
of problems identical to their homework.
Resources
Tips from Your Advisor Sample Email Text:
Here's
 a tip: Leverage the Learning Center to help you prepare for your 
upcoming exams.  The Learning Center has fantastic peer tutors that
 are willing to help you understand course concepts.  You can 
access tutoring schedules ahead
 of time to align your visit when someone is available to help you with a
 specific course.  The Learning Center also hosts a course repository on Moodle.  Here, you can find practice exams to assess your knowledge.  
Bonus tip:  Do you struggle with test anxiety?  Check out these tips for taking tests and overcoming test anxiety.
Week 4
Academic Calendar
No academic calendar activities this week
Challenges
Students
 will start getting their first exams back and may be shocked at their 
performance.  This may cause them to question their ability to be 
successful at Rose-Hulman.
Resources
Tips from Your Advisor Sample Email Text:
Here’s
 a
tip: Make use of your professor’s office hours. The phrase “office 
hours” means
your professor is available for unscheduled student visits. The time is 
reserved for students, so rest assured: You aren’t bothering
your professor when you contact them during office hours. In fact, 
professors
regularly complain that students don’t take advantage of their office 
hours!
To make your
visit or call or chat effective, formulate to the best of your ability the
question(s) you have, what you’ve done to try to figure it out on your own, and
where you think you are stuck. Your opening statement might go something like
this: 
Dr. Ingram, I need some help with the citric acid cycle homework questions. I
reviewed the slides you posted on Moodle, read the book and studied the
figures, and also answered the practice problems at the end of the chapter.
But, I can’t seem to get the molecules organized in the correct order – I think
I don’t understand how the electrons are added and lost, but I’m not sure if
that’s it. Can you give me a few pointers?

Q: What resources are available for students struggling with impostor phenomenon and how can they overcome it?
 These few sentences are so helpful to your professor.
Bonus
 tip: Everyone suffers from impostor phenomenon.  Performance on 
one exam does not define you or determine your future performance. 
 To learn how to overcome impostor phenomenon, check out this Successflix video.  
(Note: The first time you access the Successflix course, you will need to click the "Enroll Me" button.)
Week 5
Academic Calendar
No academic calendar activities this week.  Advising appointments will begin next week.
Challenges
With
 the upcoming Career Fair, many first-year students will put academics 
on hold in order to prepare, convinced that everyone will receive an 
internship offer.  While the fall Career Fair is invaluable to 
seniors who are looking for full-time jobs, freshmen tend to overrate 
the importance of attending.    
Resources
Advising
 appointments will begin next week.  Consider blocking off time on 
your calendar to review midterm grades and meet with your 
advisees.  To facilitate those appointments, a scheduler activity has been added to your individual academic advising course in Moodle.
Tips from Your Advisor Sample Email Text:
Here’s a
tip: Go to the Career Fair with the goal of learning rather than the goal of
getting a summer position. There’s time, I promise. The Career Fair is wildly
intimidating, even for me – hundreds of people milling around, long lines in
front of different booths, the noise, feeling underdressed or overdressed, and
on and on. Especially for introverts, the whole thing can be overwhelming. 
But, if you
go with the goal of learning what the Career Fair is all about, I guarantee it
will feel better. Put on business casual dress, allocate an hour, and go walk
around. Take note of how people seem to interact with each other. Challenge
yourself to introduce yourself to a recruiter who doesn’t have a line,
regardless of what the company does or what majors they are interested in.
Observe how the seniors are dressed and carry themselves. Pick up a few
brochures so you can later read about how companies advertise themselves to
prospective employees. You can put all this learning to use in the winter and
spring (yes – the Career Fair happens three times a year!).
Week 6
Academic Calendar
Midterm grades available 
Fall and winter term academic advising appointments begin
Challenges
Students
 who check their midterm grades may be shocked at their overall 
performance.  Students who do not check their midterm grades may 
have an unrealistic assessment of their performance and may assume 
everything is and will be fine.
Students are also trying to create their ideal schedules for the next term, which may or may not be realistic.  
Resources
When
 you meet with your advisees and discuss midterm grades, try using the 
Appreciative Advising approach.  Start by acknowledging the courses
 the students are doing well in, and see if the student can identify why
 they are going well (i.e., what strategies are they using to facilitate
 their success).  Then help students transfer those strategies to 
the courses that are not going well.  
There are several SUCCESSFLIX videos that can help students navigate this disappointing situation:
Parks and Restoration #1 - Redefine Failure
Parks and Restoration #2 - Cultivate Resilience
purSUITS #1 - Growth Mindset
purSUITS #2 - Grit
purSUITS #3 - Internal Locus of Control
STUDENTS #5 - Overcoming Imposter Phenomenon
Tips from Your Advisor Sample Email Text:
Here's a tip: Check your midterm grades (directions can be found HERE).  Make sure your assessment of your performance and progress matches your instructors' assessments.

Q: 
What resources are available for students who may be feeling overwhelmed, frustrated, or burned out during the academic advising process?
 We will be meeting this week to discuss your progress as well as your schedule for next term.  [Insert information on how students can sign up for an academic advising appointment.] 
 As you are creating your draft schedule, keep in mind that Rose-Hulman 
will ensure that students get the courses they need; specific 
section preferences cannot be guaranteed.

Q: "What strategies can students use to manage their workload during the most hectic time of the term?"
 Now is the
time in the term when everything starts to get really hairy. Lots of 
tests,
homework, papers, projects, etc. to do. 
Top 1 hits: True
Top 3 hits: True

Q: 
What are some tips for creating an environment for learning during times of feeling overwhelmed and lacking motivation?
 It can be overwhelming at 
times.  By creating a visual representation of your future goals, 
you can remind yourself why you are working so hard.  Why it will 
be worth focusing on homework rather than another YouTube video.  
Be sure to put the visual representation somewhere you will see it 
often!
If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider a visit to the Student Counseling Center. 
 They can help you process your thoughts and feelings as well as help 
you develop coping strategies.  They also host workshops on stress 
management, so check their calendar to see if one is coming up.
Week 8

Thursday for remaining Y1 students with freshman class standing (based on earned credit hours)
Final date to drop a course without penalty is Friday 5:00 pm
Challenges
Along with feeling overwhelmed, many students are lacking motivation to finish the quarter strong.

Q: What are some tips for creating a successful study environment and staying motivated during the end of the term?
 You may have been studying 
in your residence hall room or apartment, and while that may have worked
 before, intentionally creating an environment for learning can help 
increase motivation and focus.  We're close to the end of the term,
 but not quite there yet!  Try studying in the academic buildings 
or the Logan Library.  These spaces have academic cues that will 
remind you that your full-time job is to be a student.  Plus, 
you'll be closer to the resources that can facilitate your learning, 
such as professor office hours and the Learning Center. 
Other
 ideas to stay motivated include creating a study group; pairing 
something pleasant (like a coffee or snacks) when you need to focus on 
unpleasant tasks; creating a reward system for meeting your goals this 
week; or even posting your tuition bill to remind yourself of the 
investment you have made in your education.
Week 9
Academic Calendar
No academic calendar activities this week
Challenges
Students
 often tip the scales towards academics around this time, in hopes of 
catching up and passing their classes, often at the detriment of their 
physical, mental, and emotional health.
Resources
Tips from Your Advisor Sample Email Text:
Here's
 a tip: Don't forget to take care of yourself.  This time of the 
quarter feels like a race to the finish and it's easy to fall into the 
trap of thinking that giving up sleep means more can be 
accomplished.  Sleep is crucial to the learning process, so ensure 
that you're getting at least 7 hours each night.  Make sure you're 
eating regular meals so that your brain has the fuel it needs to 
function.  And don't forget about self-care.  Try to engage in
 something relaxing on a regular basis, even if it's just a walk around 
campus each day.  For more ideas, check out the e-book Self-Care for College Students.
Week 10
Academic Calendar
No academic calendar activities this week, but final exams will be held next week (Monday through Thursday)
Challenges
At
 this point, students realize that final exams are near.  If they 
have not had successful test experiences in the past, they may be 
worried about how to prepare.
Resources
Tips from Your Advisor Sample Email Text:
Here’s
 a
tip: Prepare now for your finals. The Learning Center will host final 
exam review sessions during Week 10 for common first and second year 
courses.  The schedule is emailed to students enrolled in those 
courses, and can also be found on the Review Sessions
 page of My Rose-Hulman.  You can attend the sessions and work
 through practice problems, asking tutors for help as needed.  Or, 
you can pick up the packet and solutions to use for self-testing later 
on.  
Think about your schedule for this week and 
next.  What can you start working on now?  How will you spend 
your time this weekend and in between final exams?  You can’t have 
more than 16 hours in a day
because I know you are reserving 8 hours for sleep, which is the most 
important
success strategy you can adopt. Assign jobs to those remaining 16 hours.
 Eight one-hour study
sessions over two weeks are so much more effective than one eight-hour 
session,
or even two four-hour sessions, I promise!!!

Updates for 2023-2024:
Clarification: Students
 do NOT have to take foreign languages; the rule in the video applies to
 those that CHOOSE to take foreign languages. Language 111 is 
appropriate for anyone who does not have previous experience with the 
language.  
Top 1 hits: False
Top 3 hits: False

Q: What courses are recommended for students with previous experience and how can transfer credit fulfill certain course requirements?
 Students who do have previous experience should take a 
placement exam prior to enrollment to be placed in the appropriate 
class.
Students enrolled in MA105 (Calculus A) will not be enrolled in PH111 in the fall.
It is not recommended that students enroll in CHEM225 or ME123 in their first term.
RH131 Rhetoric and 
Composition is replaced by HUM H190 First-Year Writing Seminar; RH330 
Technical and Professional Communications is renumbered as ENGL H290. 
Transfer credit listing ENGL H100 will satisfy the HUM H190 requirement;
 ENGL H1xx counts as an HSSA elective.

Can a student grade replace an F due to academic misconduct?
No.
A
 student who earned a penalty grade in a course due to academic 
misconduct cannot take advantage of grade replacement.  If the 
course is required, the student will have to enroll and pass the course 
to fulfill graduation requirements.  In this case, the grade earned
 both times will be figured into the GPA calculations.
Reference:  Registrar Rules & Procedures - Grade Replacement | Rose-Hulman
What do I do if my advisee wants to withdraw from Rose-Hulman?
In
 the event that a student wishes to withdraw from Rose-Hulman (i.e., no 
longer be an active student), they should contact Student Affairs to 
schedule a meeting with either Erik Hayes or Ryan Brimberry. A 
withdrawal form will be filled out during this meeting and then routed 
to the appropriate offices.  
Should
 a student wish to return to Rose-Hulman at a later time, they will need
 to contact the Registrar to be added to the agenda for the next 
Admissions & Standing meeting.  You
 may need to explain to your advisee the implications of taking time off
 with respect to their curriculum flowchart and graduation timeline.
Information regarding tuition refunds can be found HERE.
What does "eligible to begin in" mean on a student's transcript?
You may see a line on a student's transcript that looks like this:
        From Credit By Exam
        SPAN 112EL  Eligible to Begin in SPAN L112   0 CrHrs
This means that the student will get credit for SPAN111 upon completing SPAN112 with a grade of C or higher.
Another example:
        From AP - Advanced Placement Credit
        CSSE 220EL  Eligible to Begin in CSSE220   0 CrHrs
This means that the student will get credit for CSSE120 upon completing CSSE220 with a grade of D or higher. Note:
 While the student would get credit for CSSE120, in this example, the 
student cannot proceed to CSSE230 unless they get a grade of C or 
higher.
Passing grades may vary from course to course.
How do ESL courses impact HSSA courses?
Students are not allowed to enroll in HUM190 (formerly RH131) until they've completed their ESL courses.  
Students
 are technically allowed to enroll in other HSSA courses prior to ESL 
completion; however, it is recommended that they complete their ESL 
courses, then HUM190, and then other HSSA courses.
Can students transfer credit from another institution?

Top 1 hits: False
Top 3 hits: False

Q: What is the process for transferring course credits at this institution?
 Short answer, yes.  
Stipulations
Students need approval from the Department Head for the credits to transfer
Course credits can be transferred, course grades cannot be transferred
For example, if a student failed Calculus III at Rose-Hulman, and 
then transferred credit from another institution, the degree requirement
 would be satisfied, but the penalty grade would be factored into the 
student's GPA.
What changes were made to the DE curriculum?
We
 are replacing the courses MA211 Differential Equations and MA212 Matrix
 Algebra & Systems of Differential Equations with two new courses:
MA221 Matrix Algebra and Differential Equations I
MA222 Matrix Algebra and Differential Equations II
These
 courses rearrange and amend the topics currently covered in MA211 and 
MA212, and they must be taken in numerical order, as MA221 is a 
prerequisite for MA222.  Every major program of study will accept 
MA221 as a substitute for MA212, and those majors that require both 
MA211 and MA212 will also accept MA222 as a substitute for MA211.
MA211
 will not be offered after the summer 2020 term, while MA212 will be 
offered in both the summer 2020 and fall 2020 terms, with preference in 
the fall 2020 term given to students who are expected to have credit for
 MA211 by the end of the summer 2020 term.  Thus,
If you
 have not previously taken either MA211 or MA212 and expect to earn 
credit for MA113 by the beginning of Fall 2020, you should register for 
MA221.  If you are interested in taken either MA211 or MA212 this 
summer, please contact me to ensure you are taking the correct course.
If you have taken (or are taking) MA212 but have not taken MA211, you have the following options available:Take MA211 this summer as an online course.
Take MA221, which will count as a substitution for MA211.
If you have taken (or are taking) MA211 but have not taken MA212, you should utilize one of the following options:Take MA212 this summer as an online course.
Take MA212 this fall – we will preregister you for the course.
If
 you are seeking to grade replace either MA211 or MA212, you can use 
MA221 instead.  If you are looking to grade replace both MA211 and 
MA212, you would then need to retake both MA221 and MA222.
Why do we only offer Spanish, German, and Japanese?
Spanish
 is the #2 language in the United States, with German and Japanese 
historically being the most common languages for high-tech industry.
How do I use the Moodle Scheduler Activity?
Is there a way to contact all academic advisors?

Top 1 hits: False
Top 3 hits: True

Q: What is the process for transferring courses to this university and how does it affect a student's degree plan?
 Yes! There
 are two Microsoft 365 Groups that you can use in Outlook. To contact 
faculty in one of these groups, start typing the name of the group in 
the To line and it should pop up:
Grp Y1 Academic Advisors - this will contact all current freshman academic advisors
Grp All Academic Advisors - this will contact all current academic advisors (freshman academic advisors as well as upperclassman academic advisors)
What does it mean if a student is exempt from HUM190?
A student might be exempt from HUM190 (formerly RH131) based on their ACT/SAT scores.
What this means:
The student has fulfilled the degree requirement for HUM190
The student has satisfied the prerequisite for any course where HUM190 is a prerequisite.
The student does NOT get credit hours applied toward the degree program 
The student will have to fill that 4 credit hour space with another 
course (alternatively, the student can choose to take HUM190)
What is the advantage to taking General Chemistry Honors (CHEM112)?
Students
 who enroll in CHEM112 will pay for a 5 credit hour course, but on 
successful completion of the course will get 8 hours of credit (CHEM111 
and CHEM113).
Why is my advisee pre-registered for over 20 hours?
As
 a general rule, freshmen are not allowed to overload their 
schedule.  There are two situations where a student may have more 
than 18 credit hours in their initial schedule.
International
 students who will be placed into ESL courses will automatically have 
all 3 courses added to their schedule (in order to make sure they have a
 workable schedule).  These students will be taking a placement 
test to determine which of the three courses they need to take.  
Once this is determined, the extraneous courses will be dropped from 
their schedule.  This should be in place prior to the Monday 
advising session.
Students who have expressed an interest in 
some of our programs (e.g., ESCALATE) have been enrolled in the 
introductory course (e.g., EMGT100).  Again, this is to ensure that
 they have a workable schedule.  During the advising session, you 
should talk with the student about their interests and determine which 
course(s) should be dropped.  For example, if a student is ahead in
 the Physics sequence, perhaps drop PH112 and pick it up in the winter.
What is pre-registration?
Several departments have a pre-registration procedure that will allow students to apply
 to be placed into a particular section of a class before registration 
officially opens.  Note:  pre-registration will only apply to 
courses within that department.
Example: Procedure for CSSE Pre-Registration
Student fills out the form emailed by the department head and prints it out
Student
 reviews the request with the academic advisor; if the advisor endorses 
the request, both the student and the advisor sign the form
Student returns the signed form to the department secretary by the designated date/time
Typical Scenarios for Using Pre-Registration
A student is trying to graduate in 3 years, so everything must fit this quarter
A student must have a particular class or classes this quarter to graduate on time, and only one or two combinations work
A student was/will be on co-op/study abroad so must get into particular courses
A student genuinely only has one schedule that works
Scenarios Not Appropriate for Pre-Registration
A student wants to get into a popular elective
A student doesn't like morning classes, likes a particular schedule, or wants a certain professor
A student has practice or work-study and wants to be done by a certain time
A student is on track and has multiple viable schedules
How many courses can students transfer?
Students may transfer up to
three courses in any department (with no overall limit), plus all earned
AP or IB credit. 

Top 1 hits: False

Q: However, at this time, it is recommended to have the student sign a FERPA release form before writing a letter of recommendation or serving as a reference. This ensures that the student is aware of and gives consent for their personal information to be shared with a third party. It is also a good practice to inform the student of the information that will be included in the recommendation/reference and obtain their permission before submitting it.
 Can students enroll in MA111 and PH112 concurrently?
Short answer:  Students should not enroll in PH112 until they have successfully completed MA111.
Long answer (provided by Galen Duree):  It is in the best interest of the student to be comfortable with
Calculus I before going into Physics II.  We do not do a whole lot with
calculus at the beginning of Physics II, but around mid-term we do several
things with multivariable calculus covered in Calculus II.  If a student
still wants to take Physics II without passing Calculus I, it is possible to do
this but it is not recommended.  The student must talk with his Physics II
instructor and they both need to understand the situation.  If the student
and faculty member are okay with the situation, a pre-req waiver can be completed
and filed.  The student can then enroll in Physics II.  Looking at
the history of this situation, sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. 
So the purpose of the pre-req is to force a discussion to happen between the
student and Physics II instructor to try to avoid a bad situation, which
sometimes happens anyway. 
Are athletes eligible to play if they drop to part-time status?
No,
 only full-time students are eligible to participate in athletics. 
 As soon as the drop is approved by the Registrar's Office, the athlete 
is no longer eligible to compete or practice.
Do I need a student to sign a FERPA form in order to write a letter of recommendation or serve as a reference?
As
 an institute, we are working towards a process where students can 
complete a blanket form, allowing faculty to write recommendations and 
serve as references.

Q: 
What is the maximum number of HSSA courses that can be transferred for a student who is transferring to another institution?
 In the meantime, save any email requests that
 you receive as implied consent.
What if a student has more than 3 HSSA courses to transfer?
Students
 are allowed to transfer up to 3 courses to satisfy the HSSA 
requirements.  Any additional courses transferred will be counted 
as a free elective.
One of my advisees is transferring to another institution.  
Top 1 hits: True

Q: How should I handle a situation where a student's behavior is concerning or disruptive?
If you notice any disruptive, problematic, or concerning behavior or misconduct, please submit a Rose Cares Report or contact Kyle Rhodes (rhodeska@rose-hulman.edu). It is important to report any behavior that may pose a threat to the safety and well-being of the student or others. This includes anger problems, preoccupation with violence and/or weapons, strange or atypical behaviors, and any other concerning behavior. It is better to report even minor behaviors to ensure the safety and support of the student.
 Who fills out the transfer paperwork?
Typically, transfer paperwork
is completed by the Registrar’s Office and/or Student Affairs.  If the
questions seem more academic in nature, encourage the student to take the
paperwork to Registrar’s Office.  If the questions are more
non-academic related, encourage the student to take the paperwork to Student
Affairs. 
What do I do if a parent asks me to act on behalf of a student?
While
 it's hard to visualize all the different scenarios this might 
encompass, a general rule of thumb would be to act when requested by the
 student.
For example, if a parent calls and wants you to send a 
letter of recommendation to a graduate school, you can let the parents 
know that you will attempt to speak to their son/daughter about 
this.  If the student agrees with the idea, you are free to send 
the letter.  Do not send the letter without permission from the 
student; to do so would be a FERPA violation.
Emergency Situations: 
 If a parent calls because they are concerned about the safety of their 
child, please call Public Safety (x8590) right away, rather than waiting
 until you can talk with the student.  
What do I do if I am contacted by a third party (e.g., coach, case manager)?
Student Accessibility Services recommends that you do not discuss
 student information with a third party (e.g., executive function coach,
 case managers, counselors, etc.), regardless of whether the student has
 completed a FERPA form giving Rose-Hulman permission to do so.  
Remember, FERPA gives us permission to share; it does not require us to 
share.
If a third party contacts you, please forward the information to Patty Eaton (eaton1@rose-hulman.edu).  
When should I submit a Rose Cares case?
If you notice any disruptive, problematic, or concerning behavior or misconduct, please submit a Rose Cares Report or contact Kyle Rhodes  (rhodeska@rose-hulman.edu)
While not an exhaustive list, behaviors you should report include:
Anger problems
Preoccupation with violence and/or weapons
Repeated non-compliance
Strange, atypical, and aberrant behaviors
Paranoia
Acting out
Depression
Assignments that focus on threatening behaviors (to themselves or others)
Use of drugs and/or alcohol
Suicidal ideation
Other behaviors uncharacteristic of an individual's typical behavior
Even if the behavior seems minor at the time, please notify Rose 
Cares.  Rose Cares will conduct an investigation, perform a threat 
assessment, and determine the best mechanisms for support.

While
 faculty are certainly not required to craft a detailed narrative 
regarding their academic advising experience, some may choose to do so 
(e.g., faculty for whom advising is a strength).  In addition to 
the advisee counts provided by the Faculty Activity Reports, here are a 
few ideas for the narrative:
In what ways is academic advising a strength of yours? 

Top 1 hits: True
Top 3 hits: True

Q: What techniques or methods do you use to connect with students in your academic advising role? How have you incorporated pedagogical principles into your advising approach, and can you provide examples from your advising syllabus or Moodle course? Have you implemented any new strategies or resources in your advising practice, such as weekly emails? In what ways have you taken on a leadership role in academic advising, such as mentoring new advisors or managing communications on a shared Teams channel? Can you share any positive feedback or affirmations you have received from students in regards to your advising? How do you apply Appreciative Advising in your interactions with students? Please note that PTR does not require all advisors to include this information in their narrative.
 How do you connect with students? 
How
 have you applied pedagogical techniques to academic advising (e.g., 
consider sharing your advising syllabus and/or a screenshot of your 
advising Moodle course in the PTR Support Documents Folder)?
What new strategies or resources have you leveraged (e.g., weekly emails)?
How
 have you been a leader in academic advising (e.g., mentoring new 
advisors in your department; coordinating communications on a shared 
Teams channel)?
What affirmations have you received from students (e.g., consider sharing unprompted emails or notes you have received)?
How do you apply Appreciative Advising to your practice?
Again, PTR has no expectation that all academic advisors will include this narrative.

Rules & Procedures
The pages below are excerpts from the Rules and Procedures maintained by the Office of the Registrar.  Click HERE to access all of the rules and procedures.  
Attendance
The
 cumulative nature, complexity, and fast pace of the courses at 
Rose-Hulman make regular classroom attendance a necessity. There are 
also important benefits to be gained from entering into classroom 
discussion, learning to express one's own ideas, and learning from 
the ideas of others. The Faculty of Rose-Hulman
agree that regular attendance is necessary,
endorse the faculty member's right to require attendance,
support the assessment of grade penalties, including failure in the course for excessive absence, and
expect each instructor to give careful thought to and to announce attendance policy.
Stipulation
At
 the beginning of each course, the instructor has the authority to 
determine and the responsibility to announce the extent to which any 
absence, excused or unexcused, or tardiness will affect the student's 
final grade. A student whose total absences in a course, excused or 
unexcused, exceed two per credit is liable to fail the course.
Excused absences
Instructors
 will normally permit make-up work to be done when a student has 
legitimate conflicting obligations, including but not limited to 
illness, isolation, self-isolation, emergency, Institute-sponsored 
activities, or plant trips. These conflicts do not excuse the student 
from course responsibilities. The student is responsible for informing 
the instructor of any legitimate excuses and making arrangements for 
make-up work, if permitted, as soon as possible. Whenever possible, the 
student must discuss unavoidable absences with instructors in advance.
Group activities
When
 more than one student will miss class because of a scheduled school 
activity, school policy requires that a notice be circulated to the 
Faculty. The faculty sponsor for the activity must submit a roster of 
students involved, stating the purpose, time(s), and date(s) of absence,
 to the Dean of Students for approval. The sponsor is responsible for 
having this notice duplicated and distributed to the Faculty not later 
than one week prior to the anticipated absence.
Change of Major
A
 student wishing to change curriculum, i.e., move from one major to 
another, should notify the Registrar’s office as soon as possible. The 
online Change of Major Request form can be found HERE.

Q: What is the new process for dropping or adding classes as of Fall 2020 and when do students typically enroll in classes?
 Any additional information needed or steps to be taken will be discussed at that time.
Drop & Add
AS OF FALL 2020:  An electronic drop/add form replaces the paper form, and can be accessed HERE. 
Students
 other than entering freshmen and entering transfer students normally 
enroll in classes during the seventh week of the preceding term. 

Top 1 hits: True
Top 3 hits: True

Q: 
What is the procedure for making schedule changes after the first week of a term?
 See Registration for more information. The following procedures are used to make schedule changes thereafter:
Changes before the term begins: If
 Department Heads and/or the Registrar’s Office discovers a problem in a
 student’s registration (e.g., section overfilled, course cancellation),
 it may be necessary to move a student to another section of a class. 
Students should check their schedules regularly for changes through the 
first day of the term. If a student finds it necessary to make a 
schedule change, they may use their pin prior to the first day of the 
term. Students are always encouraged to speak with their advisor 
regarding schedule changes.
Changes in the first week: The
 first five days of class in a term are designated as Drop/Add week 
during which time a student may request schedule changes that were not 
completed prior to the start of term. Students initiate the request 
using the electronic Drop/Add Form from MyRose-Hulman (under Registrar 
Forms). Once submitted by the student, forms are routed electronically 
to the necessary approvers (noted below). Adding a course is only 
permitted through the fifth day of classes in the term.
Change in course or section (add and drop): Approval required by Add Instructor; Notification to Drop Instructor and Advisor.
Adding a course: Approval required by Add Instructor; Notification to Advisor.
Dropping a course: Notification to Drop Instructor and Advisor.
Changes after the first week:
Up
 until the end of the eighth week of a term, a student may withdraw from
 a course by submitting the Course Withdrawal Request form found on My 
Rose-Hulman (under Registrar Forms). The request will be electronically 
submitted for approval from the course instructor and the student’s 
advisor. 
Top 1 hits: True
Top 3 hits: True

Q: 
What are the limitations and restrictions for transferring credits to Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology?
 The student's grade in the course will automatically be 
recorded as "W" a non-penalty grade. For more information see Grades.
If
 dropping the course will result in the student being at part-time 
status, additional approval is required from the Office of Student 
Affairs. It is the student’s responsibility to contact the Financial Aid
 Office to learn of any impact part-time status may have on awards. If a
 student is dropping to part-time for the third time (or more), approval
 is required from the Admissions and Standings Committee.
A 
student who wishes to drop a course after the eighth week must have 
permission from the Admissions and Standings Committee because of 
special exigency. For more information see Grades.
If
 the penalty levied by an instructor in a case of academic misconduct is
 failure in the course, the student forfeits the right to withdraw from 
the course with a grade of "W".
Changes in a student's schedule 
necessitated by illness, Military Service, or other exigencies beyond 
control, may be made without penalty at any time upon approval of the 
Admissions and Standing Committee.
Grade Replacement
Rose-
Hulman recognizes that some students may have deficiencies in their 
background that may necessitate their repeating certain named required 
courses. The Grade Replacement provision allows them to remedy these 
deficiencies without grade penalty. It is also intended to encourage 
students who have received a marginal grade (D or D+) in a core course 
to repeat the course before proceeding to more advanced work. 
Stipulations: If
 a student receives a penalty grade (F, D, or D+) in a named course 
required in the first two years of the curriculum and repeats the 
course, then only the higher grade in the course will be used in 
calculating the cumulative GPA. (In effect, the cumulative GPA will be 
re-calculated, dropping out the lower grade.) 
This procedure may be applied to not more than two named required courses of the junior-senior curriculum. 
Limitations
All grades will be recorded; that is, the prior penalty grade will not be removed from the student's permanent record.
If the penalty grade was an F, the student must repeat the course 
prior to taking any other course for which the repeated course is a 
prerequisite.
Grade replacement cannot be used for a course in which a penalty grade was assigned for disciplinary reasons.
Procedure
The student simply registers as
 usual for any courses for which Grade Replacement applies. If a 
student, after registering, finds that a course must be repeated (e.g., 
after final grades have been reported), a Drop/Add Form must be obtained during the first week of classes in the next term. 
Overloads
The
 maximum academic load is 18 credits in any term, excluding RHIT100 
Foundations for Rose-Hulman Success, one credit hour of General 
Chemistry Honors, and Music Performance. A student wishing to take more 
than the maximum normal load must petition the Admissions and Standings 
Committee, except as noted below.
Overload policy
With the approval of the Advisor, a student who is not on academic Probation, may schedule credits in addition to the maximum normal load according to the following table:
Cumulative GPA
Maximum Overload
Less than 2.600
no overload
At least 2.600
4 credits
At least 3.300
6 credits
Procedure
A student whose GPA meets the stipulated limit for the Overload may simply register as usual.
A student whose GPA does not meet the stipulated limit must request 
an Overload by submitting a letter to the Registrar explaining why the 
exception is needed, how the additional work load will be handled, and 
indicate which course(s) are considered to be the Overload. The 
Admissions and Standing Committee will meet to consider these requested 
Overloads, usually after the final grades for the current term are in. 
The Committee will typically notify students of its decision during the 
second week of classes. The fact that a student is pursuing a double 
major or two degrees is NOT a sufficient reason for approving an 
Overload for a student who does not meet the GPA requirement. If the 
petition is denied, the student will be informed and the Overload 
course(s) will be dropped.
Fees
Students
 pay an additional fee for each credit over 18 in a term, exclusive of 
RHIT100 Foundations for Rose-Hulman Success. Consult the Registrar's 
Office.
Part-Time Student
Enrollment
 in at least 12 credits of course work in any one term constitutes being
 a Full-Time Student. A student enrolled for fewer than 12 credits of 
course work in any one term is classified as a Part-Time Student or 
Special Student. 
Guidelines
A student may register as a Part-Time Student or reduce their course 
load to become a Part-Time Student at their discretion. Being a 
Part-Time Student may have implications for:
• Financial aid and student loan repayment**
• Insurance
• Visa status for international students
• Eligibility for athletics
• Scheduling of required courses with prerequisites
• Other individual-specific concerns (e.g., ROTC contracted cadets)
Students intending to be a Part-Time Student should discuss these
 implications with their advisor and a representative from the Financial
 Aid Office, if appropriate. International students must discuss their 
intention to be a Part-Time Student with the Senior Director of the 
Center for Global Engagement. 
Limitations
Academic probation can only be removed for satisfactory work as a Full-Time Student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
If a student wishes to be a Part-Time Student for more than two 
quarters (consecutive or non-consecutive), permission must be requested 
from the Admissions and Standing Committee.  Before granting 
permission for a third term of Part-Time study, the Committee will 
evaluate whether the student is making satisfactory academic 
progress. 
Exceptions & Questions: Consult the Admissions and Standing Committee.
**As outlined in the Student Handbook
 (Changes to Part Time Status During a Term), any reduction in hours 
will result in an adjustment of financial aid based on the schedule 
below through the end of Week 6:
Reduction from full time hours (12+) to 3/4 time hours (9-11) = 25% reduction of aid
Reduction from full time hours (12+) to 1/2 time hours (6-9) = 50% reduction of aid
Reduction from full time hours (12+) to 1/4 time hours (5 or less) = 100% reduction of aid
Probation & Dismissal
At the end of any term, a student whose term Grade Point Average 
(GPA) or cumulative GPA falls below the level shown in the following 
table will be placed on Academic Probation for the succeeding term. A Transfer Student assumes the GPA requirements of the class the student enters.
Terms
Minimum Term GPA
Minimum Cumulative GPA
1-3
1.800
1.800
4-12
2.000
2.000
If a student's term GPA falls below the 
required level, the student acquires one probation. If a student's 
cumulative GPA falls below the required level, the student acquires one 
probation. It is thus possible for a student to acquire a maximum of two
 probations in one quarter. 
Any
 student placed on probation in a given term can be required to appear 
before the Admissions and Standing Committee as a condition of remaining
 in the Institute. 
Removal of academic probation
At
 the end of any term in which a student was enrolled in 12 hours or 
more, and whose term GPA and Cumulative GPA meet the minimum level as 
shown in the table above, the student will be removed from academic 
probation. All courses must be taken for graded credit, and may not 
include courses on the Audit or Pass/Fail basis. 
Dismissal for academic deficiency
A student who acquires a total of three probations in immediately 
successive terms will be dismissed from the Rose-Hulman Institute of 
Technology.
A student who acquires three probations will be allowed to remain in
 school for one term if the student's term GPA is 2.500 or better. The 
student must be enrolled as a full-time student and all courses must be 
taken for graded credit, and may not include courses on the Audit or Pass/Fail basis.
Part-time student 
The Admissions and 
Standing Committee may permit a student on probation or one who has been
 dismissed and re-admitted to enroll as a Part-Time Student.
 If sufficient GPA improvement is achieved, the student may be permitted
 to remain in school, but the probationary status will not change. 
Probation can only be removed for satisfactory work as a Full-Time 
Student. 
Readmission
Any student who has been dismissed for academic reasons
 or who has withdrawn voluntarily from Rose-Hulman and wishes to be 
readmitted must make a personal appearance before the Admissions and 
Standing Committee. The student must contact the Registrar regarding 
meeting times and dates. The Admissions and Standing Committee will 
determine whether the student shall be readmitted. 
Any student who has been suspended for disciplinary reasons
 and wishes to be readmitted at the end of the suspension period must 
submit a written petition to the Dean of Students who will review it. 
After the review, the Dean of Students will submit a recommendation to 
the Admissions and Standing Committee. In addition, the student will 
schedule and attend a meeting with the Admissions and Standing Committee
 as a condition of readmission. The student must contact the Registrar 
regarding meeting times and dates. The Admissions and Standing Committee
 will determine whether the student shall be readmitted. StipulationThe 
student may not appear before the Admissions and Standing Committee 
until all outstanding financial obligations to the Institute are 
settled.
Repeating a Course
Overlapping material
In
 some instances, with the approval of the advisor, a student may elect 
to take a course which essentially repeats material in a course already 
taken and for which credit has been received. In such cases, no 
additional credits or grade points will be recorded unless the second 
course carries more hours of credit. In that case, credit and grade 
point will be recorded to the extent by which the total number of 
credits for the second course exceeds those recorded for the original 
course. The exception to this is Grade Replacement.
Failed courses
A
 student who has received an "F" in a course must repeat the entire 
course in order to obtain credit, either by enrolling for it again at 
Rose-Hulman or by Transfer Credit. It is particularly important to note that:
Credit By Examination may not be used to obtain credit for failed courses;
The
 "F" will remain on the student's permanent record and cannot be removed
 by subsequent satisfactory work. (This is true even in the case of Grade Replacement where the "F", although no longer averaged into the student's GPA, still remains on the academic record.
Exceptions & Questions: Consult the Admissions and Standing Committee.
Transfer Credits
Courses
 successfully completed at other accredited institutions of higher 
learning may be submitted for transfer credit and possible satisfaction 
of Rose-Hulman degree requirements.
Each request for transfer 
credit is evaluated by the head of the department awarding the credit; 
the award of transfer credit is not automatic. All courses are reviewed 
to confirm that they meet the academic expectations of the department 
issuing credit; some have additional restrictions. Some courses are not 
eligible for completion via transfer credit and must be taken at 
Rose-Hulman. Some may be eligible for credit by exam but not for 
transfer credit. These restrictions may be indicated in the Academic 
Rules and Procedures, in the Course Catalog, or by the head of the 
relevant academic department.
Some pre-collegiate programs may 
bear academic credits that are not transferable to Rose-Hulman. For 
example, Rose-Hulman does not award credit for Project Lead the Way 
(PLTW) courses.
Rose-Hulman’s own summer courses and online 
courses are not transfer courses and are not subject to the limits 
stated below. Likewise, these limits do not apply to credit gained 
through Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate examinations. 

Top 1 hits: False
Top 3 hits: False

Q: 
How does Rose-Hulman evaluate transfer credits for students admitted as first-year students compared to those admitted as transfer students?
 Credit is awarded for scored performance on those exams and is not 
awarded solely for completion of an AP- or IB-designated course. 
See Credit By Examination.
For the procedure used to evaluate credits transferred by students entering Rose-Hulman, see Transfer Student.
For students admitted as first-year students:
From
 initial enrollment through graduation, transfer credit in any one 
academic department is ordinarily limited to three courses; credits 
beyond this limit may be awarded as free electives.
Study abroad 
normally entails the approval of additional transfer credit beyond the 
normal three-course limit. Plans of Study for students completing two or
 more majors may also specify additional transfer credit.
Exceptions must be approved by the head of the department awarding the credit.
For students admitted as transfer students:
Transfer
 students, who matriculated as degree-seeking students at another 
accredited college or university prior to enrolling at Rose-Hulman, are 
not subject to the same three-course departmental limit as other 
students. They are, however, subject to the two-year residence 
requirement.

Q: What are the limitations for transfer credit acceptance at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology?
 See Graduation Requirements.
Procedure
Current
 or prospective students should submit course(s) for transfer credit 
approval, by the appropriate department chair, by completing 
the "Transfer Credit Evaluation" area in Banner Web (located on the 
‘Main’ tab in Banner Web). It is recommended that current students do 
this prior to taking the course(s) to ensure approval before course 
enrollment.
Limitations:
Transfer credit is accepted only from accredited colleges and universities.
The grade earned for a course taken at another institution must be equivalent to a grade of "C" or better.
Transfer credit will not be granted for a course taken on a Pass/Fail basis.
Grades
 earned in transfer credit courses are not recorded on the student's 
Rose-Hulman permanent record and are not averaged into the 
cumulative GPA.
If a student is suspended from Rose-Hulman, the 
Rules and Discipline Committee may stipulate that the Institute will not
 accept transfer credit earned by the student at another school during 
the period of suspension.
Seniors who plan to transfer credits 
to Rose-Hulman after their last term in residence should be aware of 
special limitations that apply in addition to the ones listed below. See
 also Summer Completion.
Withdrawal
Withdrawal
 from Rose-Hulman: To officially withdraw from enrollment at Rose-Hulman
 Institute of Technology, a student should obtain a Withdrawal Form from
 the office of the Dean of Students. This Form contains a clearance from
 the Dean of Students, the Dean of the Faculty, the Advisor, and various
 departments of Rose-Hulman which may have financial charges against the
 student. No financial settlement can be made until this Form is 
completed.
In the event a student withdraws, any unpaid charges will be noted in the academic file and no requests for transcripts or readmission will be acted upon until such charges are paid.
Grades
For
 a student withdrawing from Rose-Hulman, the usual Drop/Add provisions 
apply with respect to grades. That is, if withdrawal occurs before the 
end of the 8th week, all grades will be recorded as "W"; if a student 
wishes to withdraw after 8th week the student must receive a waiver from
 the Admissions and Standing Committee because of special exigency.

Q: 
What courses fulfill the first-year writing requirement at Rose-Hulman and how has this changed due to the curriculum change?
 Subject: HUM H190, ENGL H100, and the ﬁrst-year writing requirement
From: "House, Richard" <house@rose-hulman.edu>
Date: 8/28/23, 11:06
To: Grp Y1 Academic Advisors
<GrpY1AcademicAdvisors@rosehulman.onmicrosoft.com>
Freshman advisors,
First of all, the short answer:
Before last year’s curriculum change, the ﬁrst-year wri�ng requirement at Rose was RH131, plain and simple. With the
curriculum change, that requirement is sa�sﬁed by the Rose First-Year Wri�ng Seminar (HUM H190), or by transfer
of English Composi�on ENGL H100. (HUM H190 is the requirement, but ENGL H100 is a standard subs�tu�on.) If a
student receives ENGL H1xx instead, that counts as an HSSA elec�ve.
To clarify this a bit further, I’m including the new course descrip�ons and the explana�on of why we’re handling things
this way when it comes to transfer credit. Please feel free to contact me with ques�ons for clariﬁca�on!

Q: What are the prerequisites and corequisites for the HUM H190 First-Year Writing Seminar at Rose-Hulman, and how does it differ from the ENGL H100 First-Year Composition course offered for transfer credit?
 Rich
1. Our course and its descrip�on—what students will take here:HUM H190 First-Year Writing Seminar 4R-0L-4C F, W
Prerequisites: There are no prerequisites for this course.
Corequisites: There are no corequisites for this course.
First year students at Rose-Hulman take a writing seminar to help them transition into
college-level writing and build their critical reading and thinking skills. Writing
seminars are themed around engaging and timely topics. Choosing themes that interest
them, students cultivate scholarly skills and habits that will serve them throughout
their college careers and beyond: considering diverse perspectives; reading for deep
and nuanced understanding; exploring research questions with an open mind;
engaging with others' ideas while developing their own; writing for speciﬁc audiences
and purposes; revising existing writing to incorporate feedback and new information;
and crafting well-supported, appealing arguments.
2. Transfer credit for incoming composi�on courses—the mo�on passed last spring by HSSA and Curriculum
Commi�ee:
My explanatory text: “As we've discussed, one motivation for the new HUM H190
seminar course is to diﬀerentiate its intellectual context for writing and argumentation
from composition courses that students may have taken before arriving
here. Eventually, I'd love to see just about every incoming student take a 190 seminar.
But for now, to maintain a workable number of sections, we still need to award credit
for those incoming courses that meet our stated standards. This is the description I'd
like to add to the catalog. It's intended for transfer credit only.”ENGL H100 First-Year Composition 4R-OL-4C
Emphasizes rhetorical analysis, research methods, and the conventions of academic
writing, including argumentation. This course is ordinarily awarded as transfer creditHUM H190, ENGL H100, and the ﬁrst-year writing requirement

Q: "What is the impact of receiving credit for both ENGL H100 and HUM H190 on a student's elective requirements at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology?" 
 If a student receives credit for

HSSA elective.

Q: 
What options are available for a student charged with Non-Academic Misconduct if an agreement cannot be reached regarding the facts of the case and the penalty to be imposed?
 4. Whenever a student is charged with Non- Academic Misconduct, a disciplinary 
conference will be scheduled with the Dean of Students. If the facts of the case and the penalties to be imposed can be agreed upon, the Dean of Students and the student will sign a Statement of Agreement. This 
Statement of Agreement, when signed, will constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing or any appeal and an acceptance of the findings and penalties imposed.  
5. If an agreement cannot be reached regarding both the facts of the case and 
the penalty to be imposed (i.e., a Statement of Agreement has not been 
signed) and the Dean of Students has determined that suspension from 
Rose-Hulman may be warranted, then the Dean of Students has the 
authority to suspend the student or refer the case to the Rules and Discipline Committee. If the Dean of Students determines that suspension is not an 
appropriate penalty, and a Statement of Agreement has not been signed, the 
student must select one of the following three committees to hear the cas e. 
The chair of the chosen committee must be contacted within five business days. If none of the chairs are contacted within five business days, then the 
Dean of Students will issue a ruling which is final.  
o A hearing by the Student Judicial Council. The S tudent Judicial Council 
is a committee of students appointed by the Student Government 
Association to handle cases of non- academic misconduct. The student 
may have counsel with them  (a current student, faculty, or staff 
member). Appeal of any sanctions ass igned by the Student Judicial 
Council may be made to the Institute Rules and Discipline Committee if initiated within five business days. If the chair of the Rules and Discipline Committee is not contacted within five business days, then 
the decision of the Student Judicial Council will be final. The appeal to 
the Rules and Discipline Committee will be final.  
o A hearing by the Student Affairs Judicial Board. The Board consists of 
three members of the professional Student Affairs staff and cannot include the  Dean of Students. In all cases the student may have 
counsel (a current student, faculty, or staff member) with them .

may be made to the Institute Rules and Discipline Committee if 
initiated within five business days. If the chair of the Rules and 
Discipline Committee is not contacted within five business days, then 
the decision of the Student Affairs Judicial Board will be final. The appeal to the Rules and Discipline Committee will be final.  
o A hearing by the Rules and Discipline Committee. This is a committee 
consisting of faculty, staff, and student(s) that hears cases of 
academic and non- academic misconduct. A Committee decision to 
suspend may be appealed to the Faculty (see below, "V: Appealing a 
Suspension to the Faculty"). In all other cases the decision of the Committee is final. An appeal of suspension by the Institute Rules and 
Discipline Committee decisions must be initiated within five business 
days by contacting the chair of the  Rules and Discipline Committee. If 
the chair of the Rules and Discipline Committee is not contacted within five business days, then the decision of the Rules and Discipline 
Committee will be final.  
Suspension by the Dean of Students  
1. The Dean is specific ally delegated by the Faculty the authority to suspend a 
student, temporarily or permanently. The student may appeal such a 
decision to the Institute Rules and Discipline Committee within five business 
days and should be informed of the right to do so by the Dean.  
2. The Dean, in consultation with the President of the Institute, may invoke 
summary suspension, barring a student from the Institute immediately. This 
may be done when required for the well -being of the student, of other 
persons, or of the Institute. The student must comply with this ruling but may appeal to the Institute Rules and Discipline Committee within five 
business days.  
3. A suspension ruling will be recorded on the student's academic record, unless 
the case is successfully appealed. In the c ase of temporary suspension, this 
record will be removed at the end of the suspension period. In the case of permanent suspension it will remain permanently.

Q: What is the process for appealing a penalty for academic misconduct and who can bring a case to the Institute Rules and Discipline Committee?
 15 3. In addition, the instructor may appropriately levy some further penalty, since 
the student has violated the Institute Code . Penalties include but are not 
limited to a warning, (further) lowering the course grade, failure in the 
course, or turning the case over to the Institute Rules and Discipline 
Committee.  
4. The student has the right to appeal the instructor's decision to th e Institute 
Rules and Discipline Committee. The instructor should inform the student of 
this right of appeal at the time the decision is discussed with the student.  
5. In all instances, the instructor shall submit a brief written report of the case 
and any action taken to the Dean of Students, the Head of department, and the student. In case a penalty course grade (F, D, or D+) has been assigned, a copy of the report shall also be submitted to the Registrar. These reports 
will be kept on file until the student graduates, at which time the records will 
be destroyed. If the case is successfully appealed, the records will be expunged unless the student requests that they be retained. For example, they may be retained in an instance where the course grade has been 
lowered by the instructor but the Committee subsequently exonerated the 
student. (See: "Hearings Before the Institute Rules and Discipline 
Committee: Committee Actions.")  
Bringing a Case to the Institute Rules and Discipline Committee  
1. If a student accus ed of Academic Misconduct feels that an instructor has 
been unfair or has imposed a penalty too severe the student may appeal to 
the Institute Rules and Discipline Committee.  
2. An instructor, who would like a recommendation of what further penalty 
should be  assessed or would like a penalty that carries the weight of faculty 
action, may bring the case to the Institute Rules and Discipline Committee. This should be done particularly if the instructor feels that the case is serious 
enough to warrant suspension from the Institute. In turning the case over to 
the Committee, the instructor should indicate what actions have already been 
taken in the case to aid them in judging what further penalty, if any, is 
appropriate. The instructor should also be prepared to abide by the 
recommendation of the Committee, whatever it might be.  
3. If the Dean of Students finds a student involved in more than one instance of Academic Misconduct, the Dean may bring the case to the Institute Rules and Discipline Committee.

Q: What limitations does the Committee face when reviewing cases of student appeals and what actions can they take as a result?
 In the case of a student appealing the disciplinary action of an instructor, the 
Committee may uphold the action of the instructor, may decide that the 
student is innocent, or may decide that the student has been too severely 
penalized. Accordingly, it may recommend that the instructor reconsider 
actions (such as lowering a grade) that have been taken. However, because 
of the limitations of academic freedom, the Committee is not empowered to 
change any grade. If the instructor chooses not to follow the Committee's 
recommendation the Committee will prepare a written statement of its 
findings for inclusion in the student's personal records. It is hereby specifically noted that, in cases of student appeal, the Committee may not recommend penalties in addition to those which the instructor has already 
imposed.  
2. In the case of a student appealing a suspension by the Dean of Students, the 
Committee may affirm the suspension, may mitigate the suspension 
(changing permanent suspension to temporary suspension or reducing the 
terms of suspension), or may remove the suspension and recommend that 
the Dean substitute other penalties or that no penalties be assessed. The 
Committee may not levy additional penalties. The Committee is not empowered to review other disciplinary actions of the Dean, such as 
removing a student from the Residence Halls, which may be appealed to the 
President of the Institute.  
3. In the case of a hearing initiated against a student, if the Committee finds the student innocent it may recommend, but cannot require, that any penalties previously assessed be removed. Its report shall include its 
determination of innocence and shall direct that all written reports of the 
case be expunged from the student's personal record unless the student 
requests that they be retained. For example, they may be retained in an

the student be failed in the course, suspension of the student from extra-
curricular activities, a referral of the case to civil authorities, or suspension of 
the student from the Institute. The Committee will not seek to devise 'novel' penalties or forms of restitution unless they seem clearly appropriate and do not co nstitute 'cruel and unusual punishment'.

Q: What is the process for appealing a suspension decision made by the Institute Rules and Discipline Committee?
 A decision to suspend may be appealed to the Faculty. (See below.) In all other cases, the decision of the Committee is final; which means no further appeal is permitted by the student and no penalties beyond those 
recommended by the Committee should be as sessed by the instructor.  
Suspension by the Institute Rules and Discipline Committee  
1. Should the Committee decide to suspend the student from the Institute, it 
will notify the Dean of Students, the Registrar, and the Chairperson of the 
Admissions and Standing Committee of the suspension. A student choosing 
to appeal the decision to the Faculty, may remain enrolled and in attendance 
at the Institute until the appeal has been heard, unless the Committee shall 
decide on immediate dismissal for reasons relating to the well -being of the 
student, of other persons, or of the Institute.  
2. The Committee may stipulate suspension for one, two, or three terms. After 
the suspension period the student will normally be permitted to submit a written petition to the Dean of Students who will review it. After the review, 
the Dean of Students will submit a recommendation to the Admissions and 
Standing Committee for final action. See PROBATION AND DISMISSAL and 
RE-ADMISSION. In unusual cases, such as repeated misconduct, personal 
injury, or serious violations of law, the Committee may impose permanent suspension, thus ruling out readmission.  
3. A suspension ruling will be recorded on the student's academic record, unless the case is successfully appealed. In the case of temporary s uspension, this 
record will be removed at the end of the suspension period. In the case of 
permanent suspension, it will remain permanently.

the residence halls when living with a roommate and community of other students. It is the people you meet, the memories you make, and the experiences you share together that makes residence life at Rose -Hulman an essential part of the learning 
and growing process as a student. The residence halls of Rose -Hulman play a very 
important part in a student's life while on campus. The students in these halls develop much of their perception of Rose -Hulman through their time spent in

Residence Hall Association (RHA)  
All residence hall students are members of the Residence Hall Association. RHA 
meets weekly and its major purpose is to provide a means of improving residence life in all areas. Each residence hall student pays $20.00/quarter (included in your 
bill as part of the residence hall fee) to RHA for its use in achieving this purpose.   
Each residence hall floor should select at least two representatives to attend and 
participate in RHA meetings. This does not exclude other memb ers of the floor from 
membership in RHA. All residence hall students may attend RHA and participate as voting members. RHA money is primarily distributed to floors based on attendance

It is important for resident students on campus to become familiar with all Institute policies. While the Institute has few policies governing behavior in the residence 
halls, these policies are enforced by the Office of Student Affairs staff.  
All resident students are responsible for the care of their assigned room in the halls, 
for their personal conduct, and for the conduct of their guests therein.  
Resident students should understand that the Institute does not condone and will not permit behavior in these residences which is in conflict with stated policy or 
which could create situations which might conflict with their academic endeavors as 
students (e.g., cohabitation and unlawful drug use are not permitted in any 
residence hall).  
Guests are not permitted to stay in student rooms in the residence halls without the 
prior approval from the Director of Residence Life. All students are responsible for 
their own guests.

Q: 
"What is the policy for freshmen living on campus and when can inspections occur in their rooms?"
 To make repairs;  
3. When there are reasonable grounds to believe that a condition exists that endangers health, saf ety, or security;  
4. When there are reasonable grounds to believe that unauthorized or prohibited equipment, furnishings or other materials are present in the room

in the room or apartment; or 
6. To make routine inspections for maintenance, health and safety, and to perform required services, as announced by Residence Life, RHIT Facilities, 
or Safety and Security.  
Generally, such inspection will occur in the presence of the occupant(s) of these 
quarters. However, if the suspected violation is considered to be of such a serious nature as to require immediate action when the occupant(s) is/are not present, 
inspection could still occur.  
Such inspections can only occur at the discretion of and under the authority of the 
Director of Residence Life and Residence Life staff.  
Residency Requirement  
Freshman Year  
Unless commuting from home within 30 miles of campus, all freshmen are required to live on campus. Easier availability and access to facilities, fewer distractions, and 
living with others who share common academic endeavors are primary reasons for this requirement of freshman reside nce. 
In short, the Institute feels that it is educationally sound practice to require students new to the campus to live in residence halls.

ADA Service Dog Policies  
Definition 
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, a service animal is a dog that is 
individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with 
a disability.  The work or tasks performed by the dog must be directly related to the 
person’s disability.   
Approval 
Communication regarding an ADA Service Dog living in campus housing should be 
directed to the Student Accessibility Services office.  ADA Service Dogs are allowed 
in all public domains contingent to outlined limitations.  Due regard will be given to 
current students living in the same room, floor, or residence hall and housing arrangements may have to be adjusted.  A copy of current vaccines are requested with annual update.  Records of the vaccinations will be kept on file with Di rector of 
Student Accessibility Services.  
Limitations  
Service Animal Control Requirements  
• The student must be in full control of the dog at all times. ADA Service Dogs 
must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered unless these devices interfere with 
the dog’s wo rk, or the individual’s disability prevents using these devices. In 
that case, the individual must be able to control the animal through voice, signal, or other non- disruptive means.  
• The dog should be unobtrusive to other individuals and the learning, livi ng, 
and working environment to the extent possible.  
• It is recommended that the dog wear some type of commonly recognized symbol to identify it as an ADA Service Dog, but not disclosing the disability.   
• The student should educate others in best way to interact without disrupting 
the service dog’s role.  
Student Responsibilities

Q: What actions can a student take if their service dog is removed from campus due to disruptive behavior or failure to clean up after the animal?
 33 Answers such as “it calms me” or “it provided emotional support” are not sufficient.  
Animal Etiquette  
To the extent possible, the student should ensure that the dog does not:  
• Sniff people, restaurant tabl es, or the personal belongings of others.  
• Display any behaviors or noises that are disruptive to others unless part of 
the service being provided the student.  
• Block an aisle or passageway for fire egress.  
Waste Cleanup  
Cleaning up after the animal in all indoor and outdoor campus facilities and grounds, including sidewalks and lawns, is the sole responsibility of the student. In the event that the student is not physically able to clean up after the animal, it is 
then the responsibility of the student to hire someone capable of cleaning up after 
the animal. Contact staff if arrangements are needed to assist with clean- up. Trash 
receptacles located outside the residence halls should be used to deposit waste.  
Removal

Emotional Support Animal Policies  
Definition 
Under the Fair Housing Act, emotional support animals are not service animals.  They do not perform work or tasks that would qualify them as service animals 
under the Americans with Disability Act.   An emotional support animal alleviates one or more ident ified symptoms or effects of a person’s disability. An emotional 
support animal is one that is absolutely  necessary to afford the student with a 
disability an equal opportunity to use Rose -Hulman Institute of Technology college 
housing.   
Approval Emotional Support Animal documentation forms are available in the Student Accessibility Services office.  Documentation must be completed by a qualified provider who has worked with the student over time and in- person.  The student 
should have an existing relationship with the animal.  The provider must clearly outline the need for an emotional support animal in college housing.  Completed forms should be returned to the Student Accessibility Services office.

Q: What factors does Rose-Hulman consider when determining whether the presence of an emotional support animal is reasonable? 

 Documents will be reviewed.  If a question arises, the Director of Student Counseling Services 
may be asked to participate in a team review.  If approved, the information is 
shared and processed with Residence Life.  Due regard will be given to current students living in the same room, floor, or residence hall  and housing arrangements 
may have to be adjusted, with the needs of any existing student disability or allergy 
accommodation on file taking priority.  
Each academic year, the emotional support animal must be approved according to 
this policy with Student Accessibility Services.  
Limitations  
Rose- Hulman may consider the following factors, among others, in determining 
whether the presence of the emotional support animal is reasonable and in making 
housing assignments:  
• The student must have a documented beneficial relationship with the animal.  
• The animal must be of mature age (1 year old or older) and housebroken or 
litter trained.  
• The student must be able to confirm the animal will receive annual veterinary check -ups and must comply with all state and local licensure and vaccination 
requirements.  
• The student must show proof of current vaccinations and licensure.  
• Animals that may fundamentally alter Rose -Hulman’s operations (including 
housing operations) may not be allowed. Rose -Hulman may consider whether

 pg. 5 Student Handbook Purpose  
The Rose -Hulman Student Handbook contains specific information and linked 
resources designed to provide you with the tools and guidance to help you take full 
advantage of the Rose -Hulman experience and culture.  
Mission  
The mission of Rose -Hulman Institute  of Technology is to provide our students with 
the world's best undergraduate science, engineering, and mathematics education in 
an environment of individual attention and support.  
Vision  
Rose- Hulman graduates will be inspired and prepared for lives of purpose and

Rose- Hulman will be a lifelong partner with our graduates and a recognized global 
leader in science, engineering, and mathematics education.  
Institute Student Learning Outcome s (ISLOs)  
The Rose -Hulman Institute Student Learning Outcomes (ISLOs)  articulate 
knowledge, skills, and behaviors that Rose -Hulman students are expected to 
demonstrate by the time of graduation. The outcomes are not dependent on a 
particular program of study, but rather they characterize generally what it means to be a graduate of Rose -Hulman. Through an annual summer artifact collection and 
assessment process (
RosEvaluation), the Commission on the Assessment of 
Student Outcomes (CASO) de termines student attainment of our outcomes, and the 
results help to support both institute and program continuous improvement efforts.

Q: What is the policy on drugs and alcoholic beverages at Rose-Hulman and how are students expected to comply with it?
 4. All mandatory health forms and information are available online at my.rose -
hulman.edu  
Policy on Drugs and Alcoholic Beverages  
The Institute believes that the development of self -discipline, individual 
responsibility and respect for law will be enhanced by entrusting to students a 
greater responsibility for compliance with State law and by the removal of complete 
prohibitions, whi ch are not enforceable in practice.  
Therefore, the Institute draws to the attention of all its members that it is unlawful 
for any person to sell, furnish, give or cause to be sold, furnished or given away 
any alcoholic beverages to any person under the age of 21 years. The Institute 
expects each individual student and each student living unit to assume 
responsibility for compliance with this provision of the Indiana Alcoholic Beverage Control Act on the Rose -Hulman campus. The Institute has particular concern for 
the assumption of this responsibility by students who are not yet 21 years of age 
and are, therefore, more exposed to violations of the law; this concern applies 
especially to freshman students, not merely because they are exposed to violations of the law but also and importantly because they are new to college life with its 
attendant problems of adjustment and achievement. These regulations rest on the 
assumption that Rose -Hulman students, relying on residence regulations and their 
own judicial procedures, are capable of individual and group self -discipline.  
• Each Rose student is individually and personally responsible for compliance 
with the applicable provisions of the law of the state of Indiana.  
• Alcoholic beverages may not be used by students on the campus except 
within the privacy of their own living quarters.  
• Alcoholic beverages shall not be possessed, nor consumed by students in the

functions in fraternity houses, etc.  
• Alcoholic beverages may not be dispensed on the campus or at fraternity 
houses at any time through the use of beer trucks, kegs, etc., which are 
clearly for the purpose of mass consumption by students.  
• Alcoholic beverages are not permitted at varsity or intramural athletic events.  
• Alcoholic beverages shall not be sold on the Rose campus without the approval of the President of the Institute.  
• Violations of these alcoholic beverage regulations, as of other Institute regulations, shall be subject to discipline through regular procedures.  
• Consumption of alcohol is prohibited at all athletic events. It is emphasized 
that when alcoholic beverages are used at all, they should be used in 
moderation and that the conduct of students on the Rose -Hulman campus 
shall at no time be disorderly or otherwise offensive due to immoderate use of alcohol or for any other reason. The Institute does not condone violation of 
the State law concerning the use of alcoholic beverages under any 
circumstances when such use impairs personal health, academic 
achievement, or the best interest of the Rose -Hulman community.

that drugs and the potential for drug abuse do not exist here. They do exist here,

Q: 
What are the areas of specialization offered within the chemical engineering department's graduate program?
 The chemical engineering master's programs offer a unique opportunity for an individual to broaden and enhance his or her undergraduate training with concentrated study in a specialized area of chemical engineering. The program is a blend of "traditional" programs based on full-time, resident graduate activity and "industrial" programs that can be beneficial to students employed in nearby industries or to those who want to alternate periods of full-time graduate work and full-time work in industry.

The department offers two graduate path alternatives. Our Master of Science (MS) degree program is a traditional thesis-based approach whereby the student pursues both laboratory and course work culminating in the preparation and oral defense of a written thesis. Our Master of Chemical Engineering (MChE) degree is a course-based master's program which requires additional coursework or project study in lieu of a traditional thesis.

Areas of specialization within our department include energy and sustainability, separations, biochemical engineering and biosystems, process and transport modeling, process control and optimization, petroleum engineering, thermodynamics and molecular simulations, polymers, interfacial phenomena and nanotechnology, and particulate materials.

The department also offers undergraduate students who are ahead in their courses to work towards a master's degree while still completing their bachelor's degree. Students who wish to pursue this path should talk to their advisors.

The objective of both programs, the Master of Chemical Engineering and Master of Science in Chemical Engineering, is to prepare graduates for early career advancement in the field of Chemical Engineering by building upon their undergraduate training with advanced coursework and concentrated study of problems and topics relevant to the field.

Q: 
"What are the key differences between the Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (MSEE) and Master of Electrical and Computer Engineering (MECE) degree programs offered by the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology?"
 Electrical & Computer Engineering

Two post-graduate degree programs are offered by the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology: the Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (MSEE) degree, that requires a thesis and a publication, and the Master of Electrical and Computer Engineering (MECE) degree that does not require a thesis or a publication, but instead requires 12 credit hours of additional course work.

Both degree programs combine mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science to meet the demands of the highly volatile field of electrical and computer engineering. A student's plan of study for the MSEE degree is arranged by the student, the student's advisory committee chairperson, and the student's advisory committee. The MSEE student's advisory committee must consist of at least (1) an RHIT ECE faculty member serving as the major advisor who guides the student's thesis research, (2) a second RHIT ECE faculty member, and (3) an RHIT faculty member from outside of the ECE department. Similarly, an MECE student's plan of study is arranged on an individual basis through a joint agreement between the student and his or her academic advisor, who must be a member of the RHIT ECE faculty.

Both degree programs seek to build upon the basic foundations established by the student's undergraduate course of study.

Q: What are the key differences between the Master of Science in Engineering Management (MSEM) and Master of Engineering Management (MEM) programs?
 ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT

The engineering management master's program facilitates students' educational experiences to distinguish themselves from other engineers in the workplace. Through various instruction modes and experiences, students develop leadership and technical skills to positively address the human (behavioral) and technical opportunities presented in today's global work environment. The goal is to provide students with discipline-free managerial, leadership, and technical skills that accentuate their undergraduate STEM degrees and elevate their career trajectories.

The department offers two variations of the master's degree: Master of Science in Engineering Management (MSEM) and Master of Engineering Management (MEM).  The MSEM degree requires a combination of coursework and a capstone project, while the MEM degree does not require a capstone project but instead requires eight (8) additional credit hours of graduate-level coursework. Both degree programs require three (3) one-credit hour EMGT graduate seminars, which expose students to relevant engineering management topics and experts that they would not be exposed to in other classes.

Within the course offerings of engineering management, students can explore the areas of entrepreneurship, operations, Six Sigma, and systems engineering as they relate to the discipline.

Both degrees' objective is to prepare graduates for a diverse set of career opportunities in STEM fields or career advancement in their current field of study. We achieve these objectives by building upon their undergraduate training with advanced coursework and topics relevant to the engineering management discipline.

MSEM and MEM Graduate Student Learning Outcomes

Student Outcomes are statements that describe what students are expected to have by the time of graduation.

Acquire and apply knowledge or skills to demonstrate an understanding of political, economic, social, technical, environmental, or legal (PESTEL) issues relevant to engineering management.

Apply engineering or managerial knowledge to analyze organizational concerns or devise solutions utilizing appropriate qualitative or quantitative tools.

Meet objectives or create value (for a project, process, or organization) through individual or collaborative effort.

Master of Science in Engineering Management (MSEM)

The MSEM degree curriculum includes eight credit hours of an integrated project for students who want to investigate business practices, managerial principles, and engineering concepts and their impact on organizational operations. Students will be able to engage in research related to the engineering management discipline. Course requirements for the MSEM degree include:

20 credit hours of technical courses

20 credit hours of managerial courses

8 credit hours of Integrated Project (2 credit hours for proposal and 6 credit hours for research)

3 credit hours of EMGT Graduate Seminar

There is some flexibility with the balance of credits between the technical (20 credits) and managerial (20 credits) areas.  In consultation with your academic advisor and with approval from the Department Head, a student may be allowed to shift some credits between these two areas, weighting one area more than the other.

Master of Engineering Management (MEM)

The MEM degree is a course-based professional degree for students seeking an in-depth understanding of the engineering management discipline and its application to their undergraduate program of study.  Like MSEM students, MEM degree seekers develop business acumen and management/leadership skills to solve the socio-technical demands of today's workplace. Course requirements for the MEM degree include:

20 credit hours of technical courses

20 credit hours of managerial courses

8 credit hours of graduate-level elective courses

3 credit hours of EMGT Graduate Seminar

There is some flexibility with the balance of credits between the technical (20 credits) and managerial (20 credits) areas.  In consultation with your academic advisor, and with approval from the Department Head, a student may be allowed to shift some credits between these two areas, weighting one area more than the other.

Q: What are some potential areas of impact that advancements in the biological sciences could have in the 21st century, and how will the biology program at Rose-Hulman prepare students to address these challenges?
 Biology

The twenty-first century will see unparalleled advances in the biological sciences that will greatly impact the way we live. The areas of functional genomics and proteomics will drive discoveries in molecular medicine, gene therapy, and tissue engineering. Drug discovery will be facilitated by the elucidation of new target molecules and many pharmaceutical compounds will be produced using biological processes. Environmental management, remediation, and restoration will also advance as a result of new techniques and perspectives that emerge from the century of biology. Biologists will be at the forefront of the advances that will drive progress in medical, agricultural, environmental, and related industries.

The biology program will equip biologists with the deep biological understanding along with chemistry, mathematics, and physics background needed to solve biotechnological problems in the coming decades. The program will prepare graduates for professional careers in government and industrial research laboratories, and in the biotechnology and health-related industries. Those wishing to continue their studies in graduate or health professions programs will be exceptionally well qualified to do so.

Q: 
What are some examples of medical devices that are designed and analyzed by biomedical engineers specializing in biomechanics?
 Biomedical Engineering

Biomedical engineers use science, engineering, and mathematics to understand and solve medical problems. We focus on improving people’s quality of life. Biomedical engineers who specialize in biomechanics design and analyze biological systems or medical devices that have to do with forces, stresses, and strains. This includes studying the motions of bodies or joints, fluid flow, the deformation of tissues or materials, and the transport of molecules and chemicals through tissues and across membranes.

Biomedical engineers who specialize in bioinstrumentation use electronics and signal analysis to take measurements from and deliver stimuli to living cells and tissues. Examples include cochlear implants, pacemakers, and patient monitoring equipment.

Q: What opportunities are available for graduates of the chemical engineering program at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and how does the program prepare students for these opportunities? 
 Chemical Engineering

As has been done since we awarded the nation’s first degree in chemical engineering in 1889, the undergraduate program in chemical engineering undertakes to prepare individuals for careers in the chemical process industries. These include all industries in which chemical and energy changes are an important part of the manufacturing process, such as the petroleum, rubber, plastics, synthetic fiber, pulp and paper, fermentation, soap and detergents, glass, ceramic, photographic and organic and inorganic chemical industries. In view of the dynamic nature of this technology, the course of study stresses fundamental principles rather than technical details. It prepares the student either for advanced study at the graduate level or for immediate entrance into industry. Opportunities in the process industries are found in a variety of activities, including design, development, management, production, research, technical marketing, technical service, or engineering.

Mission: The mission of the Department of Chemical Engineering at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology is to provide an excellent chemical engineering education through a combination of theory and practice that prepares students for productive professional careers including postgraduate studies.

Program Educational Objectives

Our graduates will attain a promotion and/or responsibilities beyond their entry-level position, or progress toward the completion of an advanced degree.

Curriculum

The curriculum covers a breadth of fundamental principles so that the chemical engineering graduates have a working knowledge of advanced chemistry, material and energy balances applied to chemical processes; thermodynamics; heat, mass, and momentum transfer; chemical reaction engineering; separation operations, process design and control. The program provides students with appropriate modern experimental and computing techniques in unit operation laboratory and requires them to work in teams and submit written and oral reports on their laboratory projects. A capstone experience in senior year gives students an opportunity to integrate their knowledge. Also included is the study of health, safety, environmental and ethical issues in the chemical engineering profession.

Graduate work leading to the degrees of Master of Science in chemical engineering or Master of Chemical Engineering provides a more thorough understanding of the discipline and enhances a student's ability to handle complex problems. A thesis is required for the Master of Science degree, but not for the Master of Chemical Engineering degree. Most recent graduate students have chosen research topics in biotechnology, polymers, or automatic control, but other specialties also are possible.

The chemical engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org, under the commission’s General Criteria and Program Criteria for Chemical, Biochemical, Biomolecular, and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.

Q: 
"What role does project-based learning play in the education of civil engineers?"
 Civil Engineering

Civil engineering is a people-oriented profession that has long been in existence to serve the needs of mankind. It evolved as a formal discipline at the start of the 19th century with the advent of society’s need for increased mobility and convenience. The role of the civil engineer has always been one that deals primarily with public works: the planning, design, and construction of airports, bridges, buildings, and transportation, irrigation, flood control, water supply and waste disposal systems. These civil engineering works not only manage our environment, but are part of the environment itself and, by their very nature, have important social and economic impacts.

The civil engineering curriculum is designed to give the student a sound education in preparation for this role. The first two years include courses that deal with the principles of mathematics, physical and engineering sciences on which engineering concepts are based, as well as courses in humanities and social sciences and introductory courses in engineering and design. The last two years are devoted to developing the necessary technical competence, as well as the ability to apply the knowledge that the student has acquired to the design and synthesis of complex civil engineering projects. Project-based learning is an essential ingredient, and a year-long, client-based capstone design project highlights the senior year.

The entire curriculum is oriented to develop a student’s ability to think critically and logically.

Q: What are the core courses included in a computer science curriculum?
 Computer Science

The Computer Science curriculum prepares students for careers in all areas of the computer industry as well as for graduate studies in computer science and computer related fields. Students have also found a computer science major to be excellent preparation for careers in law, medicine, business administration, industrial engineering, biomedical engineering, and other technical and non-technical fields.

Computer science is a rapidly changing discipline. The lifetime of a particular computer system or software package can be very short. The computer science curriculum is designed to prepare students for multiple careers in a rapidly changing environment. The department’s courses emphasize fundamental concepts and techniques that will last longer than present technology.

Computer science majors complete a core of basic computer science courses that includes the study of algorithms, data structures, database concepts, computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and software engineering. Majors also complete important courses in closely related fields, e.g., discrete mathematics, digital logic design, and probability and statistics. The major requires students to study all aspects of the science of computing, including hardware, software, and theory.

Courses in database systems, compilers, computer graphics, fractals and chaotic dynamical systems, artificial intelligence, theory of computation, analysis of algorithms, computer networks, computer vision, web-based information systems, and cryptography are available as advanced electives. A three-term senior project provides valuable practical experience in the specification, design, implementation, and documentation of large software systems. Qualified students can undertake independent study in advanced topics in computer science, participate in a research project with a faculty member, or complete a senior thesis.

Programming assignments and large projects are part of most computer science courses. These assignments familiarize students with the wide variety of tasks performed by software professionals. Programming assignments include system specification, system feasibility studies, system design, system maintenance studies, and user interface design in addition to system implementation (i.e., coding), testing (verification and validation), and documentation. Projects include both individual and team activities and require appropriate written and oral presentations.

Computer science majors have diverse interests and career goals. Five free elective courses allow students to tailor their undergraduate education to their specific goals. Students planning to undertake graduate study in computer science usually take additional advanced courses in computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematics.

The department has its own local area network.

Q: 
What opportunities do students have to work with external clients during their time in the Engineering Design major?
 Students also work with external clients starting in their first quarter on campus.

Engineering Design

Engineering design is a human-centered endeavor that grew out of investigations of creativity.  While design is an integral part of all engineering fields, design methodology gained more attention during the 1980s as global competition demanded higher quality design and system complexity increased. The role of the designer is to create a system, process, product, or service based on stakeholder needs while considering social, environmental, economic, and safety requirements. The designer must have both a mindset and skillset for improving the impact of design on society. The mindset requires the vision and drive necessary to create value. The skillset includes the tools and techniques critical to realize the design.

The Engineering Design major prepares students by giving them repeated, intensive design experiences with real clients. From the first quarter to the senior year, students participate in authentic design experiences and practice professional skills. The first year gives students a broad understanding of modeling systems across disciplines and repeated practice in prototyping solutions for clients. Students select a concentration and prepare for their practicum as they continue deeper in the design process. Second year students also learn the process of on-boarding into existing projects as they work with seniors one quarter and freshmen another. Transitioning to the third year, students participate in two 20-week practicums. Students are required to delve into the design process. In the junior year, the curriculum is structured to allow study-work abroad and/ or cooperative work experiences. In their senior year, students complete their concentrations and participate in a year-long, multidisciplinary capstone design experience.

After completion of this curriculum, students will be prepared to enter the engineering profession or advanced study. A student may also use this academic background as a stepping stone to a position in management, administration, or some other non-engineering field.

Q: 
"What specific courses and curriculum does Rose-Hulman offer to fulfill the 36 credit hours in humanities, social sciences, and arts as part of its general education program?" 
 General Education

As a specialized institution with a focus on science, engineering, and mathematics, Rose-Hulman approaches Institute-wide general education differently than most schools. In fact, we seldom use the term “general education,” although our programs still seek to provide each student with a broad liberal education that complements their technical disciplines.

Each student will complete, as a part of their program, at least 36 credit hours in the humanities, social sciences, and arts (HSSA). Additionally, due to the technical nature of our programs, students will complete over 35 credit hours of foundational math and science courses. Students will also complete RHIT 100 – Foundations for Rose-Hulman Success.

In total, this equates to 72 credit hours (54 equivalent semester credit hours) of what would typically be included in a general education program. Student learning is systematically reviewed as part of Rose-Hulman’s assessment and continuous improvement practices at both the institute and program levels. Technical learning outcomes are defined and evaluated at the program level.

The learning outcomes for general education are defined and evaluated at the Institute level:

Rose-Hulman Graduates will be

Critical Thinkers – develop evidence-based conclusions through a process of informed evaluation and judgement.

Effective Communicators – communicate effectively with a range of audiences through a variety of media.

Informed Global Citizens - engage with diverse beliefs, cultures, languages, or societies.

Ethical Professionals - identify ethical and professional responsibilities, behave with integrity and responsibility, and make informed judgments.

The general education outcomes are primarily assessed using student artifacts collected from HSSA courses.

Q: 
"What are the special requirements for taking a modern language and how many credits can be counted towards HSSA requirements?"
 Technical and Professional Communication is a requirement for most majors, and counts toward the total requirement of 9 HSSA courses.

Modern Language

Students who elect to take a modern language should note the following special requirements:

A minimum of two terms of the same language (or the equivalent thereof) must be completed in order to apply modern language credits toward Humanities and Social Sciences requirements. If only SPAN L111, JAPN L111 or GER L111 is completed, that course will not be allowed to satisfy an HSSA requirement.  For transfer credit, a single modern language course at 4 credit hours may be used to satisfy an HSSA requirement if it is higher than the entry level course (L111) in that language. Example: Transfer credit awarded for SPAN L113 could be used to satisfy one HSSA course requirement.

HSSA credit will not be awarded for a lower-level language course until the student takes and passes the next course in the language sequence with a grade of C or better.

No more than 16 credits of modern language may be counted toward HSSA requirements.

Students may not earn modern language credit in their native languages.

Note: Students planning to study abroad should be sure to have their program approved ahead of time by the head of the HSSA Department and by the head of the Department in which they are majoring.

Minors 
Students may elect a minor in most of the HSSA Department's disciplines. In addition, several interdisciplinary minors are available. (See below.)  A student taking a minor in HSSA must take a minimum of ten to eleven courses.

Minor

A student may elect to take an Minor in Anthropology, East Asian Studies, Economics, European Studies, Geography, German, History, Japanese, Language and Literature, Latin American Studies Philosophy and Religion, Political Science, Psychology, Spanish or Theatre and Drama by concentrating 5 to 7 HSS courses in that area. NOTE: All Minors require taking one additional HSS course, for a minimum of 40 HSSA credits (44 in the case of foreign languages). See the specific requirements listed under each Minor.

Q: What types of careers can students pursue after completing the International Computer Science curriculum?
 International Computer Science

The International Computer Science curriculum prepares students for careers in all areas of the computer industry as well as for graduate studies in computer science and computer related fields. Students have also found a computer science major to be excellent preparation for careers in law, medicine, business administration, industrial engineering, biomedical engineering, and other technical and non-technical fields.

Computer science is a rapidly changing discipline. The lifetime of a particular computer system or software package can be very short. The international computer science curriculum is designed to prepare students for multiple careers in a rapidly changing, global environment. The program’s courses emphasize fundamental concepts and techniques that will last longer than present technology.

International computer science majors complete a core of basic computer science courses that includes the study of algorithms, data structures, database concepts, computer systems, computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and software engineering. Advanced courses in theory of computation, computer networks, distributed systems, security, and real time systems add depth to the degree program. A three-term senior thesis provides students the opportunity to research in depth an area of computer science that is of interest to them under the mentorship of a faculty member. Majors also complete important courses in closely related fields, e.g., discrete mathematics and probability and statistics, as well as study a foreign language. The major requires students to study all aspects of the science of computing, including hardware, software, and theory.

Five free electives allow students to tailor their undergraduate education to their specific goals and pursue topics of interest to them. Students may choose to do advanced elective work in computer science and software engineering and/or in the humanities and social sciences, and/or pursue a minor or double major in another discipline.

Programming assignments and large projects are part of most computer science courses. These assignments familiarize students with the wide variety of tasks performed by software professionals. Programming assignments include system specification, system feasibility studies, system design, system maintenance studies, and user interface design in addition to system implementation (i.e., coding), testing (verification and validation), and documentation. Projects include both individual and team activities and require appropriate written and oral presentations.

The department has its own local area network. This network is connected to the campus-wide network and the Internet. Department laboratories provide docking stations and large screen monitors for students to attach their laptops to. International computer science majors have unlimited access to the department’s laboratories.

 Mathematics

Why study mathematics? Many of the new wonders that we take for granted in our modern technological society have mathematical ideas and applications as their basis, though this role is often hidden from view. Complex economic and planning decisions, scientific discoveries that improve our lives, and new technologies and products are often possible only after mathematical or statistical analysis, or a computer visualization, simulation, design and implementation based on mathematics. Therefore, mathematicians, as well as mathematically educated scientists, engineers and economists, make important daily contributions in the understanding and advancement of science, the improvement and discovery of new technology, and decision-making and planning in business, industry and government. Students interested in using their mathematical skills in solving real world problems are well prepared, by majoring or minoring in mathematics, for careers such as in the insurance industry, software design, data and systems analysis, scientific computing, combustion research, the animated movie industry, and cryptanalysis to name a few, or a graduate degree in a related technical field. Those students with a very strong interest in mathematics itself can pursue graduate study in mathematics in preparation for careers as university or college mathematics teachers and in the development of new mathematical and statistical concepts and methods as researchers in academia, government and industry.

The curriculum of the program in the Department of Mathematics is designed to provide a broad education in both theoretical and applied mathematics. It also develops the scientific knowledge and the problem solving, computing, and communications skills that are critical to a successful mathematically based career. This preparation is greatly enhanced by taking advantage of the wide variety of science and engineering courses available to students and developing good communications skills, both through technical courses and the strong humanities program. The program offers a solid grounding in the foundational areas of calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, discrete and combinatorial algebra, and probability and statistics. These basic courses are complemented by a varied selection of upper division courses for further elective study in areas such as numerical analysis, operations research, advanced statistics, mathematical modeling, optimization, and other advanced topics in mathematics. Students are encouraged to develop a strong background in an area of science or engineering through election of courses leading to a minor or double major. By appropriate course selection students may complete a double major in mathematics and another field such as computer science, physics, chemistry, applied biology, or economics.

PROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

To provide a foundation for further learning as well as contributing to the general education of students, the programs at Rose-Hulman all have a heavy investment in mathematics and science in the first two years. The freshman and sophomore mathematics curriculum is designed to contribute to this foundation by ensuring that students are familiar with basic mathematical and statistical concepts, and mathematical and statistical reasoning and modeling. Students will also understand the use of mathematics in other disciplines as well as developing an appreciation of mathematics as a discipline in its own right. In addition, students will learn to be competent users of mathematics, especially in problem solving, and be able to effectively communicate mathematically. The curriculum makes strong use of computer methods to develop students’ mathematical understanding and to enhance their ability to use the computer in modeling, computation and problem solving.

For students seeking a major in mathematics, the curriculum prepares them for a mathematically based career after graduation or further graduate study. The major builds upon the goals and objectives of the freshman and sophomore curriculum. In addition to a deeper and broader study of mathematics, majors will further develop their ability to formulate and solve problems from a mathematical perspective, become familiar with the use of mathematics in other fields, and develop competence at the application of mathematics to at least one other field. Graduates will also be able to use technology effectively in mathematics and the application of mathematics. To complement these technical skills graduates will learn the professional skills of effective communication with both technical and non-technical audiences and the ability to work cooperatively with others.

Mathematics Program Goals and Student Learning Outcomes

Mathematics majors should be able to meet the following Student Learning Outcomes

Goal 1:  Students will learn the fundamental principles underlying the major areas of mathematics

Q: 
What are the requirements for a second major in Computational Science and what learning objectives will students achieve through this program?
 SUGGESTED SCHEDULE

The schedule (Course Sequence) on the right is a suggested schedule only. Scheduling of courses may be altered, subject to the approval of the advisor, in order to take advantage of advanced placement or to accommodate a second major, area minor or other special program. However, note that some courses are offered only at certain times during the year, and all prerequisites must be met. In the schedule an MA elective is either a concentration elective or free math elective, as described above, and a science elective is a physical or life science elective as defined on this page.

Alternate Science Schedule: The recommended science schedule of six science courses starts with PH 111. If CHEM 111 is required in the fall quarter because of a double major or minor, then the alternate science sequence may be completed by taking the second science course in each place where a choice is given. Two science courses are to be taken in the winter quarter of freshman year.

COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE MAJOR (CPLS) (Second Major Only)

Computational methods are widely employed in science and engineering for simulation, experimentation, analysis, and design. In many areas the use of high-performance computing is essential. The Computational Science major provides Rose-Hulman students with the opportunity to add to their primary major a second major that increases their knowledge and skill in applied scientific and engineering computation.

Computational Science Program Student Learning Objectives:

Graduates with a second major in CPLS will have an ability to:

1.) Develop goals for a computational model such that the results will inform a scientific/engineering decision or provide a desired level of understanding

2.) Choose a computational modelling approach that meets the goals and implement it

3.) Validate a computational model of a complex phenomenon or system and demonstrate that the goals have been met

MINOR IN MATHEMATICS

Any student not pursuing a major or second major in either mathematics or in biomathematics may obtain a minor in mathematics by taking 10 or more mathematics courses as follows:

Six courses in foundational mathematics 



Calculus, Matrix Algebra and Differential Equations, Introduction to Proofs : MA 111, MA 112, MA 113, MA 221, and either MA 222 or MA276.

Introductory Statistics or Probability: either MA 223 or MA 381

Sixteen additional credit hours of “upper division” courses:



Courses selected from MA 222, MA 223, MA 276, all MA courses numbered 300 or higher (except MA351-356 and MA450, MA492-494, and MA496-498), all BMTH courses numbered 300 or higher (except BMTH 496-498), or other MA courses approved by the minor advisor for mathematics. Computer Science majors cannot use either MA 473 or MA 474 to satisfy both their computer science major requirements and the requirements of the mathematics minor.

Approval and Math Minor Form

All minors must be approved by the minor advisor and the student’s advisor. The department has a form for the planning and approval of a mathematics minor.

Notes and Limitations on Requirements:

Almost all students are required to take six foundational courses as a requirement for their major; therefore only four "extra courses" are required for most students.

Only MA111, MA112, MA113, MA221, MA222 and one of MA223, MA381, or MA382 can be counted towards any combination of the multiple minors offered by the mathematics department.

No student can take both MA 371 and MA 373 for credit.

No student can take both MA223 and MA382 for credit

Except as noted above, if MA 381 is being counted towards the four additional courses then, MA 223 may be taken and counted towards the Introductory Statistics and Probability.

Science and engineering, especially the most recent "high tech" developments, have sophisticated mathematical and statistical concepts and methodologies as their foundation. Thus a well-chosen set of courses for a mathematics minor (or a second major in mathematics) will greatly enhance a student's analytical and computational skills. Students thinking of going on to graduate school should especially give consideration to this option.

MINOR IN COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE

Any student may obtain a minor in Computational Science by taking the following courses:

Five courses in foundational mathematics: MA111, MA112, MA113, MA221,  MA222

Basic computing course: CSSE 120 or departmental equivalent of at least 4 credit hours

Introductory Computational Science courses:



MA332 Introduction  to Computational Science

Q: 
What are the limitations and requirements for obtaining a minor in statistics, and what steps must be taken to plan and approve the minor?
 The department has a form for the planning and approval of a minor.

Notes and limitations on requirements

Almost all students are required to take the five foundational courses as a requirement for their major

Most majors should be able to apply the basic computing requirement and/or one of the elective courses towards their major.

Math majors or double majors are  not allowed to count MA332 and MA342 for both the minor and the major.

A student may  not apply the four upper-division courses toward both this minor and a math or statistics minor.

MINOR IN STATISTICS

Any student may obtain a minor in statistics by taking ten or more mathematics courses (24 credit hours) including the following:

4 credit hours – Foundational Statistics Course:

One of the following:

MA 223 Engineering Statistics I

MA 382 Introduction to Statistics with Probability

If MA 381 is taken before MA223/MA382, it will be strongly recommended the student take MA382 instead of MA223.

20 credit hours – Additional Coursework:

Five courses selected from the following list, at least two of which must be starred (*). Courses not on this list may count towards the minor if approved by the statistics minor advisor.

MA 381 Introduction to Probability with Applications to Statistics

MA 383 Engineering Statistics II

MA 386 Statistical Programming

All minors must be approved by the minor advisor and the student's advisor. The department has a form for the planning and approval of a minor.

Notes and Limitations on Requirements

Almost all students are required to take either MA223 or MA381 as a requirement for their major; therefore, only five “extra courses” are required for most students.

Only one of MA223, MA381, or MA382 can be counted towards any combination of the multiple minors offered by the mathematics department.

Mathematics majors or biomathematics majors must have at least 16 credit hours of separation between their major and this minor.

No student can take both MA223 and MA382 for credit.

Note that MA481, MA483, and EMGT472 have MA381 as a pre-requisite.

Q: 
What job opportunities are available for graduates with a degree in Optical Engineering?
 Optical Engineering

The science of light, once confined to research labs and science fiction novels, has found its way into our everyday lives. The applications of optics can be seen everywhere. A list of more common examples of these applications include laser printers, fiber optic communication, internet switches, fiber optic telephone lines, compact disc players, credit cards bearing holograms, grocery checkout scanners, computers and eye surgery. The field of optics is an enabling technology and is growing at a rapid pace. Optical techniques are found in a wide range of areas such as surveying and construction, measurements of material parameters and deformation, flow measurements, communications, machine vision, laser cutting, drilling and welding, data storage, internet switches, optical computers and sensors etc. Surveys show that there is a growing demand for optical designers/scientists/ engineers every year. Opportunities for graduates in Optical Engineering are available in many industries, including automated inspection, consumer electronics, fiber optic communications, optical instrumentation, laser devices, radar systems, data storage etc.

The Optical Engineering bachelor’s degree program is one of the few in the country. This program provides a firm foundation for those interested in continuing thier studies in optics at the graduate level, as well as for those going into industry. The curriculum was developed by the faculty with input from industrial representatives as well as from renowned national and international optics educators. Because of the diverse applications of optics, the curriculum contains a mix of courses in physics and mathematics as well as humanities and social sciences. The Optical Engineering program at Rose-Hulman stresses laboratory instruction. We also encourage students to look at options for a double major, especially Optical Engineering with electrical, computer or mechanical engineering.

Students majoring in degree programs other than Optical Engineering are eligible to obtain an area minor in Optical Engineering.

The Department of Physics and Optical Engineering also offers an M.S. (Optical Engineering) degree. The masters level degree program complements the B.S. (Optical Engineering) degree program. Highly motivated students may obtain both a B.S. and an M.S. in Optical Engineering in a five-year period. A plan of study for this program must be approved by the end of the student’s junior year.

Q: What courses will be offered as part of the new certificate program in Optical Communications?


 This leadership is in no way limited to only traditional areas of study. One of these new areas that had a high impact in technology is optical communications. It is a rapidly growing field requiring investment beyond the traditional program structure, and is well suited to the students at Rose-Hulman All these topics are closely related to well established disciplines as optics and electronics. Considerable R&D efforts are allocated in both university and industrial laboratories enhancing the demand for both researchers and engineers with expertise in the field.

We propose the creation of a new certificate program in Optical Communications to enhance the programs currently offered. Combining expertise in Optical and Electrical Engineering, this program requires an interdisciplinary emphasis that is beyond the traditional content of either of its parent programs. This program is more than just the creation of the certificate program Optical Communications. This program will be critical to help developing a more interdisciplinary interaction for students and faculty. The creation of a workgroup within the faculty of both departments will coordinate current courses and resources, create new courses of interest for the field, and develop a showcase testbed education and research laboratory. Primary objectives include the removal of redundancy from existing courses, increasing interaction between the PHOE and ECE Departments, and improving opportunities for students in the field.

This certificate is designed to give the student a firm theoretical and practical working knowledge in the area of fiber optic devices, optical communications, networks and its applications. The main purpose is to couch these fundamentals in a context that serves as the backbone for device, components and sub-system development for use in high-speed optical data and information links and networks. At the end of the program the student will be expected to:

Understand the fundamental operation characteristics of high-speed optoelectronic components, such as laser transmitters, light modulators and receivers and passive fiber optic components as connectors, couplers, filters, and switches.

Understand the technology and performance of analog and digital fiber optic links, optical amplification and optical wavelength division multiplexing and optical time division multiplexing networks.

Have hands-on working knowledge of the use of fiber optic test equipment and techniques used by industry and telecommunication companies to test the performance of optical fiber links and components, such as, optical time domain reflectometry, optical spectrum analyzers and optical bit error testing equipment.

The Certificate will consist of 20 credit hours of which 12 credit hours will be required courses. Students interested in pursuing this Certificate should contact an ECE/PHOE certificate advisor (Professors Duree, Granieri, Alisafaee, Reza, Joenathan, Siahmakoun).

Q: â Technical elective courses: Students are strongly encouraged to take technical elective courses from the approved list. Students may petition to use other technical electives with the approval of the PHOE Department Head.

Questions to ask:

1. What kinds of jobs are available for students with a Certificate in Device Fabrication?
2. How does the experience in simple device fabrication provided by the Certificate benefit future engineers?
3. What courses should a freshman take in their Fall and Winter semesters?
4. What is the total credit requirement for the Certificate in Device Fabrication?
5. Are there any required courses outside of the device fabrication field?
6. Can students choose their own technical elective courses, or do they have to be approved by the PHOE Department Head?
7. Are there any specific computing courses recommended for students in this program?
8. How does the certificate prepare students for careers in "process" industries?
9. Are there any opportunities for students to gain hands-on experience in device fabrication?
10. What kind of math and science courses are required for this program?
 These jobs include not only those directly related to device fabrication, but also those involved with testing and trouble-shooting electronic equipment and the design of machines that contain electronic equipment. The experience in simple device fabrication that the Certificate provides is particularly useful for future engineers in “process” industries.

Q: 
What are the different aspects of software engineering that students can expect to learn in the curriculum?
 Software Engineering

Software engineering is the creation of software using a process similar to other engineering disciplines. It allows for software to be reliable and developed within time and cost estimates. The software engineering curriculum prepares students for a career in reliable, economical software development.

Programming is only one phase (construction) of software engineering. There are many other aspects of the software engineering process, such as requirements definition, architectural design, and quality assurance, which need to be applied in order to develop reliable software on time and within budget constraints. The software engineering curriculum provides students a solid background in both the theory and practice of all phases in the software engineering process, beginning with their first course of study in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, and continuing to the end of the senior year.

Since software is a non-physical product developed and executed on computers, the software engineering curriculum has computer science as its primary engineering science. The computer science courses taken by software engineering majors include the study of algorithms, data structures, database concepts, computer architecture, programming languages and operating systems. Software engineering majors also complete important courses in other closely related fields, such as discrete mathematics, digital logic design, and engineering statistics.

Coverage of software engineering topics begins in a three-term introduction to software development during the freshman and sophomore years. This study continues with coverage of core software engineering areas in the junior year, including software requirements, software architecture, software design, software project management, software construction, software maintenance, software evolution, software quality assurance, and formal methods in software specification and design. All of these courses include individual and team projects relevant to that particular area of software engineering. These projects generally include both written and oral presentations, building upon a technical communication course which introduces the student to the skills necessary for this important aspect of being a software professional. Throughout the senior year, a capstone team project develops and delivers software for a “real-world” client, which is put on display locally at a public exposition.

Throughout society, software exists for a wide variety of application domain areas. Each student is required to take at least three courses in a particular application domain, so that RHIT software engineering graduates can more effectively apply the software engineering principles they learn to that domain area. Students can choose from a variety of domain areas, including engineering, scientific and commercial applications.

Courses in various computer science topics such as computer graphics, artificial intelligence, computer networks, computer vision, web-based information systems, and cryptography are among those available as advanced electives. In addition, free elective courses allow students to tailor their undergraduate education to their specific goals.

The department has its own local area network.
