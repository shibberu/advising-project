Q: What should I do if a student exhibits concerning or disruptive behavior?

If a student exhibits any concerning or disruptive behavior, it is important to take action by submitting a Rose Cares report or contacting Kyle Rhodes (rhodeska@rose-hulman.edu). This can include behaviors such as anger problems, preoccupation with violence and/or weapons, repeated non-compliance, paranoia, depression, or use of drugs and/or alcohol. Even if the behavior seems minor, it is important to notify Rose Cares so that an investigation can be conducted and appropriate support can be provided. Remember, it is always better to be proactive in addressing concerning behavior rather than waiting for it to escalate.
